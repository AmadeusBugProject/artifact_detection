`THREE.Triangle: .normal() has been renamed to .getNormal().`

`node inspect my-script` will listen a port and start debugger cli

`node --inspect my-script` will only listen a port

> I did not found any document about how to enter debugger cli with custom port

note: It's be cool that timers.promises is require('timers/promises') in node's REPL
