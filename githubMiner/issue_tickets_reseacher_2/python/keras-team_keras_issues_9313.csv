0,1,rescale is called after mean and std are calculated in ImageDataGenerator
1,1,The `fit` function in ImageDataGenerator calculates the mean and std over X before rescaling while the `standardize` function applies the mean and std (calculated previously) after rescaling. This is leading to different results while running the data generator without `rescale` with manual rescaling before it is passed to the data generator and running data generator with rescale.
