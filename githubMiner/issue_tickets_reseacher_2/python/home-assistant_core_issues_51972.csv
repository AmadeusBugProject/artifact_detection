0,1,Pre-commit does not validate  __init__ return type
1,1,### The problem
2,,
3,1,"A plugin to check `__init__` return type was introduced in https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/50868 which let CI tests check the `__init__` return type for pull requests, however unless I am missing something it looks like this is not aligned with `pre-commit` of the dev container. This creates a situation where local tests pass but the PR fails the CI if `__init__` return type is missing."
4,,
5,1,@KapJI do you think we can align `pre-commit` to run this as part of local tests?
6,1,Thanks.
