1,1,I'm trying to do something like this:
2,,
3,0,``` yaml
4,0,- include: bootstrap.yml role=$item #or ${item} or even {{ item }}
5,0,  vars:
6,0,    env: development
7,0,"    instance_groups: [default, sshable, app-servers, dns-clients]"
8,0,  with_items:
9,0,    - test
10,0,```
11,,
12,1,"But it does not work. $item is undefined, so variable _role_ assignd to string ""$item"" instead of value of that variable which is supposed to be ""test"". This code doesn't work too:"
13,,
14,0,``` yaml
15,0,- include: app-server.yml role=${item}
16,0,  with_items:
17,0,    - test
