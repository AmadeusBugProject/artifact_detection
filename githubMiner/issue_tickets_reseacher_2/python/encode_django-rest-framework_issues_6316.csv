0,1,Ordering with ordering_fields: Every single letter of a field-name is offered as sort criterion
1,1,## Checklist

3,1,- [x] I have verified that that issue exists against the `master` branch of Django REST framework.
4,1,- [x] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
5,1,- [ ] This is not a usage question. (Those should be directed to the [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-rest-framework) instead.)
6,1,- [ ] This cannot be dealt with as a third party library. (We prefer new functionality to be [in the form of third party libraries](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/third-party-resources/#about-third-party-packages) where possible.)
7,1,- [ ] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
8,1,- [ ] I have included a failing test as a pull request. (If you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue.)

10,1,## Steps to reproduce
11,1,I have a ModelViewset like this:
12,0,```python
13,0,class ObservationViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
14,0,"    """"""Viewset for observations"""""""
15,0,    queryset = Observation.access.all()
16,0,    serializer_class = ObservationSerializer
17,0,    filter_class = ObservationFilter
18,0,    search_fields = ('code')
19,0,    ordering_fields = ('effective_datetime')
20,0,```
21,,
22,1,In settings.py I have configured the following default filterbackends:
23,0,```python
24,0,    'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS': (
25,0,"        'django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend',"
26,0,"        'rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter',"
27,0,"        'rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter',"
28,0,    )
29,0,```
30,,
31,1,"When I invoke the Filters dialog in the DRF UI for the observations, it is turning every single letter of the word 'effective_datetime' into two options, one for ascending, one for descending sorts."
32,1,**Ordering**
33,0,e - ascending
34,0,e - descending
35,0,f - ascending
36,0,f - descending
37,0,f - ascending
38,0,f - descending
39,0,e - ascending
40,0,...
41,,
42,1,## Expected behavior
43,1,"Two options: ""effective_datetime - ascending"", ""effective_datetime - descending"""
44,,
45,1,## Actual behavior
46,1,See above.
