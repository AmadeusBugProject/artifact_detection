14,1,Home Assistant will bind to multiple interfaces on port 5353 (mDNS). 
15,1,This leads to UDP4 socket memory issues and UDP4 lost packets.
16,1,"Below is a netstat extract that shows the issue on my system. The PID is the one used by home assistant. The other redundant interfaces that it binds to get choked by packets. Issue is clear if you have a tool to monitor the health of your system, like netdata."
17,1,"Running ha-core on docker without net=host ""solves"" the issue, but we obviously lose a lot of functionalities from ha itself (e.g. ps4 discovery - which doesn't work even with the proper port exposed on docker - lg tv integration, aqara integration, etc.)"
18,1,"HA is the only container that I'd like to run with net=host for the added functionalities, but getting constant notifications from netdata of lost udp packets is worse. Disabling notifications for this issue is like sweeping it under the rug, not a fix."
