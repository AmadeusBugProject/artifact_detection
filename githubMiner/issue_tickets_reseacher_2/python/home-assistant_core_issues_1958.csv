0,1,Missing jinja extension: Expression statement
1,1,Make sure you run the latest version before reporting an issue. Feature requests should go in the forum: https://community.home-assistant.io/c/feature-requests
2,,
3,1,**Home Assistant release (`hass --version`):**
4,0,0.18.2
5,,
6,1,**Python release (`python3 --version`):**
7,1,Python 3.4.2
8,,
9,1,**Component/platform:**
10,1,Template sensor
11,,
12,1,**Description of problem:**
13,1,"I have like 9 temperature sensors around my house and thought i'd create a ""average temperature""-entity."
14,1,But to get that to work i'd have to do something like this
15,,
16,0,```
17,0,{% set temperatures = [] %}
18,0,{% for state in states.sensor -%}
19,0,"  {% if state.attributes.unit_of_measurement == ""Â°C"" %}"
20,0,    {% do temperatures.append(float(states(state))) %}
21,0,  {% endif -%}
22,0,{%- endfor -%}
23,0,{{ temperatures | sum / temperatures | temperatures.length }}
24,0,```
25,,
26,1,But it seems like the jinja [expression statement are missing](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/extensions/#expression-statement) because i get this error in the template editor
27,,
28,0,```
29,0,TemplateSyntaxError: Encountered unknown tag 'do'. Jinja was looking for the following tags: 'elif' or 'else' or 'endif'. The innermost block that needs to be closed is 'if'.
30,0,```
31,,
32,1,**Expected:**
33,1,jinja2.ext.do to be available for templates
