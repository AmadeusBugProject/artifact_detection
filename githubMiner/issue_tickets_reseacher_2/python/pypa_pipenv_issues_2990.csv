520,1,This is a general question. I know that venv names are made out of project name (folder name) and ``slug value``. For example for me here it is ``simple-v0MobB9A``. 
521,0,
522,1,With venvs created with ``pipenv==2018.5.18`` doing ``pipenv shell`` was transforming my prompt into
523,1,(note the space after venv name)
524,0,```
525,0,(simple-v0MobB9A) machine42 ➜  simple git:(master) ✗
526,0,```
527,0,
528,0,
529,1,Now after updating to ``pipenv==2018.10.9`` I am getting
530,0,```
531,0,(simple)machine42 ➜  simple git:(master) ✗ 
532,0,```
533,0,
534,1,"It is awesome that the ``slug value`` is skipped, however, the missing space between ``(simple)`` and ``machine42`` is bothering me. It's a minor issue (don't know if actual issue or bug?) but I find it aesthetically unpleasant and have no idea where it comes from."
