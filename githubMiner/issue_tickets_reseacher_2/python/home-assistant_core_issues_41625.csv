8,1,## The problem
9,0,<!-- 
10,1,  Describe the issue you are experiencing here to communicate to the
11,1,  maintainers. Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened.
12,0,-->
13,1,"After restarting Home Assistant, it hangs on ""Home Assistant is starting, not everything will be available until it is finished."" permanently. The Nabu Casa Remote UI is unavailable, and the ""Cloud"" menu option in the Configuration menu is not visible (i.e. http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/cloud/ does not load)."
14,0,
15,1,"With some debugging, I found that I can bypass the issue by removing `cloud:` from my `configuration.yaml`. Home Assistant then starts normally and everything works (without remote UI access, obviously), but adding `cloud:` back causes this issue once again."
16,0,
17,1,"This issue started happening suddenly on Oct. 10th, with no known changes between when it was working and when it started failing."
18,0,
19,1,There are others having this same problem on the community forum. Link to that commentary [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-is-starting-not-everything-will-be-available-until-it-is-finished-0-115-3/229856).
