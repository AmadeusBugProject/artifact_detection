0,1,Rename modbus register to address in modbus.sensor
1,1,Currently HA aopted the use of addresses and not registers. It's fine with service
2,0,```
3,0,  - service: modbus.write_register
4,0,    data:
5,0,      unit: 1
6,0,      address: 207
7,0,```
8,1,But with sensor it uses the word register which is not correct.
9,,
10,0,```
11,0,    - name: VSR Filter age
12,0,      slave: 1
13,0,      register: 601
14,0,```
15,,
16,1,So it would be best to rename register: to address: to make things straight forward
