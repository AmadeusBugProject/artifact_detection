14,1,**Description of problem:**
15,1,I'm using matrix as chatbot and as notifier. Notifier works reliable but the chatbot (hub component) only works a few minutes and later on does not respond any longer to any predefined keywords.

18,0,```yaml
19,0,matrix:

23,0,  rooms:
24,0,"    - ""!secret matrix_room"""
25,0,  commands:
26,0,    - word: Mond
27,0,      name: Mondphase
28,0,      rooms:
29,0,"        - ""!secret matrix_room"""
30,0,```
31,1,"This is an example hotword I've configured. It works as expected, when hass is restarted."

33,1,**Additional information:**
34,1,I have set logger to `homeassistant.components.matrix: debug` but there is no sign of an error. Component quietly stops working.
