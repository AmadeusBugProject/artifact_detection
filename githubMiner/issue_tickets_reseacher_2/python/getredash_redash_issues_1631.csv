0,1,Error running query: <type 'exceptions.ImportError'> No module named pyspark.sql
1,1,Hi! Amazing tool for visualization!
2,1,I am focusing on visualizing data with python. I have a package for reading data from MySql in python and visualizing it.
3,,
4,1,Now I wanted to take a step further - visualizing data from Spark. I created a small pyspark script that imports pyspark.sql.
5,1,I am getting this error message:
6,1,**Error running query: <type 'exceptions.ImportError'> No module named pyspark.sql**
7,,
8,1,"I can run the script from CLI from python (which means I have included the $SPARK_HOME/python to PYTHONPATH), but I cannot do it from redash."
9,1,Do you have any idea how I can get redash to read the pyspark libraries?
101,,Is it documented anywhere how to add python libs to redash?
11,,
12,1,Thank you in advance!
