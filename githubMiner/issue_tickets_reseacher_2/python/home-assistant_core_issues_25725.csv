69,1,**Additional information:**
70,1,"I've followed many topics since last year, and already tried the following:"
71,1,"* deleting cookies, known devices: I've deleted the cookie, and no known device was created by google. Also after deleting the cookie file, first attempt creates another error (readwrite), but the second restart seems OK - except this reported error."
72,1,"* Acitivity page: my synology does not shown up in the activity page of google, and it never did. Also I can log in from phone/PC to this account without any problem - and of course, it shows up in the activity."
73,1,* Device security: There is no 2FA to this brand new google account I created just for homeassistant.
74,1,"* No need of password: yesterday in this thread (https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/pull/9918) I found, that there is a breaking change: no password required. Well I'm not sure if it's released already (merged 17 days ago) or not, but my version (updated yesterday) still needs password or throws config error."
