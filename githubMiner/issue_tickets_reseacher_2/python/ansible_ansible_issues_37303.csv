22,1,##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
23,1,CentOS 7
24,,
25,1,##### SUMMARY
26,1,I was very happy to find the dconf module but it doesn't work on CentOS 7.
27,1,It requires the dbus-run-session binary that comes with dbus >= 1.8
28,1,CentOS 7 comes with dbus 1.6.
29,,
30,1,"I saw in the original pull request https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/23015, some discussions about falling back to dbus-launch."
31,1,I think that would be really nice to enable CentOS 7 support. This is a distribution which is widely used.
32,,
33,1,##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
34,1,I have created a repository to reproduce the issue using molecule. See https://github.com/beenje/ansible-dconf-centos to run the following tasks:
35,,
36,0,```yaml
37,0,- name: install CentOS dependencies
38,0,  import_tasks: configure-centos.yml
39,0,  when: ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'
40,,
41,0,- name: install Debian dependencies
42,0,  import_tasks: configure-debian.yml
43,0,  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
44,,
45,0,# psutil >= 4.0.0 is required by the dconf module
46,0,- name: install a recent version of psutil
47,0,  pip:
48,0,    name: psutil
49,0,    state: present
50,,
51,0,- name: change cursor size in system settings
52,0,  dconf:
53,0,"    key: ""/org/gnome/desktop/interface/cursor-size"""
54,0,"    value: ""48"""
55,0,    state: present
56,0,  become: true
57,0,  become_user: vagrant
58,0,```

60,1,"When running molecule converge, I get:"
