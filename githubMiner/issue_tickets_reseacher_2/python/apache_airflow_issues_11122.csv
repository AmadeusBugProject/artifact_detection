0,1,Missleading Documentation for min_file_process_interval
1,1,**Apache Airflow version**: 1.10.11
2,,
3,1,**Environment**: Service as part of a Docker Swarm
4,,
5,1,- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**:

10,1,**What happened**:
11,,
12,1,Setting `min_file_process_interval` to a high value delays the execution of DAGs by up to the time specified for `min_file_process_interval`.
13,,
14,1,**What you expected to happen**:
15,1,"We use Airflow as a deployed Docker container. We modify our DAGs locally and deploy a new version of the image every now and then. Thus the DAG definitions the deployed Airflow service uses will never update while the service runs, and to save processing resources, we expected setting `min_file_process_interval` will make Airflow very seldom look for updated DAG definitions."

18,,
19,1,>after how much time (seconds) a new DAGs should be picked up from the filesystem
20,,
21,1,"This sounds to me as the delay between checks for updated DAG definitions, so I don't understand why this setting delays DAG executions."
