0,1,numpy.packbits doesn't accept a bool array
1,1,Example of problem
2,,
3,0,```
4,0,data = numpy.array([True])
5,0,byte_values = numpy.packbits(data)
6,0,```
7,,
8,1,"This results with an exception -- TypeError: Expected an input array of integer data type. This seems to go against the documentation of the function, which says it expects a 'binary-valued array'."
9,,
10,1,"To make this work, you need to first convert the data type of the array to int, which seems redundant. eg."
11,,
12,0,```
13,0,"byte_values = numpy.packbits(numpy.array(data, dtype=int))"
14,0,```
15,,
16,1,A better use case of where I encountered the problem.
17,,
18,0,```
19,0,data = numpy.random.sample(1024)
20,0,truth_values = data >= threshold
21,0,bits = numpy.packbits(truth_values)
22,0,```
