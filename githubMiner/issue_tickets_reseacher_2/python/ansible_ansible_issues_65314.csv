0,1,Ansible role duplication at meta folder
1,1,I wanted to include two same roles in my meta/main.yml dependencies.
2,1,Below is Role-01:
3,,
4,0,```
5,0,dependencies:
6,0,- role: ansible-role-service-account
7,0,    vars:
8,0,      service_account: test_user1
9,0,      service_account_group: test_user1
10,0,```
11,,
12,1,Below is Role-02
13,,
14,0,```
15,0,  - role: ansible-role-service-account
16,0,    vars:
17,0,      service_account: test_user2
18,0,      service_account_group: test_user2
19,0,      service_account_groups: test_groups
20,0,      service_account_shell: /bin/bash
21,0,      service_account_public_key:
22,0,      service_account_sudo_enabled: true
23,0,```
24,,
25,1,"When execute, the Role-02 will overwrite Role-01 which it will create groups, add public key and  make a sudo account based on Role-02. "
26,,
27,1,Any method to prevent it from overwriting as stated above?
28,,
29,1,Thank you.
