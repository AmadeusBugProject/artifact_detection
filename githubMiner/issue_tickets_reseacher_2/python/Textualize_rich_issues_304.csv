0,1,[REQUEST] progress bar: round up task.speed
1,,
2,,
3,1,**How would you improve Rich?**

5,1,"I love `rich`'s `ProgressBar`, but I have a very small issue with it: I can't seem to find a way to display `task.speed` without all the decimal numbers. "
6,,
7,,
8,1,This is how I'm defining my `ProgressBar`:
9,0,```
10,0,progress = Progress(
11,0,    TextColumn(
12,0,"        ""[bold magenta]Step {task.completed}/{task.total} - {task.speed} steps/s"""
13,0,"    ),"
14,0,"    # ""[progress.description]{task.description}"","
15,0,"    BarColumn(bar_width=None),"
16,0,"    ""â€¢"","
17,0,"    ""[progress.percentage]{task.percentage:>3.0f}%"","
18,0,"    TimeRemainingColumn(),"
19,0,)
20,0,
21,0,```
22,1,But the `task.speed` get's printed with loads of decimal numbers which doesn't look great:
23,0,```
24,1,Step 44/3000 - 0.31283405731719177 steps/s
25,0,```
26,,
27,1,"I've tried adding `>3.0f` to `task.speed` to truncate the float number, but this results in an error because before the first iteration is completed `task.speed` returns `None` and `None` cannot be formatted so that gives an error. "
28,,
29,1,Ideally `task.speed` should return a rounded number (e.g. to the third decimal) or a way should be put in place to have this option (even avoiding to return `None` before the first iteration would be enough).

31,1,"Thanks, and thank for developing this awesome library :)"
