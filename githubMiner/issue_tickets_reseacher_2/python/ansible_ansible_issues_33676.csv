22,1,##### SUMMARY
23,1,"Currently the `openssl_csr` module's `subject_alt_name:` requires items in the format: ""DNS:my.domain.name"", yet any data stuctures we use to define environments would not have ""DNS:"" already appended to the domain name..."
24,,
25,1,"Unfortunately, it's going to be very difficult to do something along the lines of:"
26,0,```
27,0,openssl_csr:
28,0,   ...
29,0,"   subject_alt_name: ""{{ item.key }}"""
30,0,"with_dict: ""{{ some_varriable }}"""
31,0,```
32,,
33,1,"Since you'll need to prepend ""DNS:"" to each of the values in `item.key`."
34,,
35,1,"I suggest that you create `dns_subject_alt_name` that takes a list of domain names and prepends ""DNS:"". If `subject_alt_name` is also used, those values could be appended to the result of `dns_subject_alt_name`, though realistically can probably be mutually exclusive.."
36,,
37,1,"If there is significant enough usage of the other SAN values (Email addresses, IP addresses, URIs...) it could be worth adding those, though I suspect they aren't used enough to be worthwhile."
