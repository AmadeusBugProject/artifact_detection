8,,
9,1,### Describe the problem
10,1,"According to the [GPU-Dockerfile](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/blob/master/tensorflow_serving/tools/docker/Dockerfile.devel-gpu), it needs to add `--config cuda` to the `bazel build` command to enable the GPU support."
11,,
12,1,"However, according to the [bazel releases page](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases),"
13,0,```
14,0,"--[no]allow_undefined_configs no longer exists, passing undefined configs is an error."
