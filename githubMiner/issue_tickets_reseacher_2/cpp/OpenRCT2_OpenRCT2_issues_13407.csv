6,1,**Explanation of the issue**
7,1,"When constructing a ride using dinghy slide track, selecting either covered track or chain lift deselects the other option, even with the ""Allow chain lifts on all track pieces"" cheat enabled. It was previously possible to create such a piece (covered track with chain lift) in vanilla using 8cars, and is also possible to achieve this through the tile inspector, but not through the ride creation menu"
