8,1,Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
9,1,**My Issue/Question**
10,,
11,1,"Drawing 1361 circles renders as expected, but drawing 1362 and greater circles creates strange artifacts. The artifacts become more pronounced as the number of circles increases, and include horizontal lines drawn from corner to corner, the rendering becoming skewed, some circles having incorrect x/y locations, etc.. "

15,1,Steps to reproduce the behavior:
16,1,Run minimal example below.
