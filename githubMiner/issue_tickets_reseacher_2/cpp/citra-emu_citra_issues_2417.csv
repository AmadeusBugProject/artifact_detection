0,1, 7cfe3ef Crashing (won't load at all) in macOS Sierra.
1,1,I compiled citra yesterday in 10.11 on my MBP 2011 and had it working as nicely as can be expected.
2,1,"I tried to run it on a Hackintosh (better processor, better GPU and more RAM) to see how it would go and it wouldn't run, I got a segfault. I assumed maybe I needed to compile it with 10.12 as a target so I rebuilt all dependencies from scratch on the Sierra machine, using 10.12 x86_64 as target and eventually got around to compiling Citra, but it will won't run."
