9,1,"**Summary:** Node editor displays all clips, and that makes hard to work on. Is that by design? "
10,,
11,1,### Reproduce
12,1,1. Create a new sequence
13,1,2. Add two solids
14,1,3. Select one solid
15,,
16,1,"**Result:** Node Editor will display nodes for both solids, even if we filter by ""Selected Blocks"" (if that relates)"
17,,
18,1,**Expected:** Node Editor should display nodes only for the selected solid;
19,,
20,1,"**Further:** There is same behavior even if we place solids on different channels (eg Video 1, Video 2)"
