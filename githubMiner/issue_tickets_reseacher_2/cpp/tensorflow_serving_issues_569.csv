0,1,Export classifier models with output tensors with rank greater than 2
1,1,"Hi, I have a text sequence model that outputs a 3-D tensor. `[batch_size, max_sequence_length, num_classes]`. Language models and sequence labeling models have this type of shape, whereas a classifier model will have shape `[batch_size, num_classes]`."
2,,
3,1,My `SignatureDef` for my outputs is the following:
4,,
5,0,```
6,0,The given SavedModel SignatureDef contains the following output(s):
7,0,outputs['scores'] tensor_info:
8,0,    dtype: DT_FLOAT
9,0,"    shape: (-1, -1, 9)"
10,0,    name: Reshape_1:0
11,0,```
12,,
13,1,"When I run the model (e.g. four words nine classes), I get an `AbortionError` from the shape mismatch."
14,,
15,0,```
16,0,"grpc.framework.interfaces.face.face.AbortionError: AbortionError(code=StatusCode.INVALID_ARGUMENT, d\"
17,0,"etails=""Expected Tensor shape: [batch_size num_classes] but got [1,4,9]"")"
18,0,```
19,,
20,1,Would I have to reshape the output tensor for the request and reshape it back?
21,,
22,1,I am using the following code to create a classifier request.
23,,
24,0,```
25,,
26,0,"    channel = implementations.insecure_channel(HOST, int(PORT))"
27,0,    stub = prediction_service_pb2.beta_create_PredictionService_stub(channel)
28,,
29,0,    request = classification_pb2.ClassificationRequest()
30,0,    request.model_spec.name = 'default'
31,0,    request.model_spec.signature_name = 'results'
32,0,    example = request.input.example_list.examples.add()
33,,
34,0,    example.features.feature['text_ids'].int64_list.value.extend(
35,0,"        [1, 2, 3, 4])"
36,,
37,0,"    result = stub.Classify(request, 10.0)  # 10 secs timeout"
38,0,```
39,,
40,1,Thanks
