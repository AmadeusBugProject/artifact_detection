0,1,message dedup
1,1,"I am using spdlog in a project that is v noisy when tracing and sends lots of dup messages. I quickly hacked a dedup mechanism into spdlog so that it says 'last message repeated nn times' and it seems like this would be a useful feature. I have probably done it very poorly (code in the wrong place, blows up yr performance,...) and there are no control knob (enabled /disable, threshold for min dups,...) so any pull req would be bounced"
