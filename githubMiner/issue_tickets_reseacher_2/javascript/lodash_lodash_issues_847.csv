0,1,Any desire for a deep rename with obj/array support in Lodash?
1,1,In another project I'm working on we frequently come across the need to do deep renames of objects and objects within arrays. I end up needing this a lot when dealing with REST services like social media APIs to extract the useful bits into a simpler structure.

69,1,"In some cases we need to reach inside objects and pull keys to the root level. In other cases we need to return more deeply nested objects based on root keys. Either way, the function I have breaks it down so I can do all of it with a single function call with, I think, a fairly natural syntax."
