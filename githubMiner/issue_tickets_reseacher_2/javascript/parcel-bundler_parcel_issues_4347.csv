0,1,@parcel/validator-typescript can report incorrect errors when dependencies change
1,1,# 🐛 bug report
2,0,
3,1,"In testing PR #4237 (which tries to fix issues that can occur with `@parcel/validator-typescript` when multiple files change at the same time), I discovered a pre-existing problem where `@parcel/validator-typescript` will not report correct errors in situations where a dependency (such as an interface definition) changes, but the files that depends on the changed file (e.g. one that consumes the interface) does not.

49,1,## 🤔 Expected Behavior
50,0,
51,1,"When you start the above project with parcel (by running `parcel src/index.ts`), it should build with no warnings (because the initial types of both `index.ts` and `App.ts` are valid)."
52,0,
53,1,"Now, change _only_ `returnMessage.ts` to:"
54,0,```ts
55,0,"export function returnMessage(message: number):number { // we've changed the type to 'number', which is not what index.ts is expecting"
56,0,    console.log(message);
57,0,}
58,0,```
59,1,Parcel should re-validate the project and show this error:

72,1,## 😯 Current Behavior

74,1,Parcel does not report any errors.
75,0,
76,1,## 💁 Possible Solution
77,0,
78,1,"Currently, `@parcel/validator-typescript` will only call `getSemanticDiagnostics` for the files that have changed. Since `index.ts` did not change, `getSemanticDiagnostics` will not be called, and the error will go unreported."
79,0,
80,1,"I took a look at the way that `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` addressed this issue, and it appears that they take the simple-but-slow approach of [re-analyzing _every_ file in the typescript program whenever _any_ file changes](https://github.com/TypeStrong/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin/blob/54a51c707d064f8a52c4f599ac592355094c2f6e/src/IncrementalChecker.ts#L230-L247)."
81,0,
82,1,"This would work as a backup, but we might also be able to improve performance if we were able to use parcel's dependency graph to only re-analyze the files that depend on the files that changed."
83,0,
84,1,It might also be possible to use Typescript itself to perform the same analysis - see [this (still open) issue where someone was asking for this feature](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5192).
