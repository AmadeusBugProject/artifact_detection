0,1,Grid mess up when using responsive typography
1,1,I have played around with using responsive typography (see #17095).
2,,
3,1,"When you add responsive font-size on the body element, the container (of properly other things) gets messed up because of the reliance on ems/rems."
4,1,"Explained: The grid breakpoint in .container is relative to the font-size, so if you increase the font size on bigger screens, then you also increase the breakpoints."
5,,
6,1,Is this undesired behavior (bug)  or should one manually correct the breakpoints to fit with the different font-sizes based on the same breakpoints :confounded: ?
