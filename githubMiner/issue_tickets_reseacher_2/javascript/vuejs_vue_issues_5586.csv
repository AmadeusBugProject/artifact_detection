4,1,### Reproduction link
5,0,[https://jsfiddle.net/9zcdvdxu/4/](https://jsfiddle.net/9zcdvdxu/4/)
6,,
7,1,### Steps to reproduce
8,1, - Click in the text input
9,1, - Type any letter (h)
10,1, - Hit enter
11,1, - Two events triggered
12,1, - Hit enter again; no event (expected)
13,,
14,1,### What is expected?
15,1,"Enter to not trigger an event, just like it normally does if you do not type anything before it."
16,,
17,1,Same behavior as in 2.6.2 see https://jsfiddle.net/hcnok29L/4/
18,,
19,1,### What is actually happening?
20,1,"It adds an extra event when hitting the enter key, but it doesn't do so when hitting the enter key normally without anything typed in front of it."
21,,
22,0,---
23,1,"We couldn't find any reason or explanation for this within the changelogs, assuming it is not intended behavior. A customer complained that our autocomplete stayed open after they hit the enter key and it didn't previous week. The fix was easy, move the keydown keyup for canceling the up-coming request. But is was kinda strange bug."
