0,1,Discussion: relevance of and issues with explicit form-control class
1,1,"I'm aware this isn't a bug report nor a feature request per se, so I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I don't know where else to post this. I am quite surprised that I haven't found any blog posts, Github issues or even SO posts about this (other than [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18386234/is-there-a-solution-for-using-asp-net-mvc-5-html-editorfor-and-bootstrap-3-0) and [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18364255/twitter-bootstrap-3-text-inputs-in-mvc-razor-view-are-hiding-first-couple-char))"

3,1,"Referring to pull request #8611, ""Updated BS3 form classes"", I'd like to re-raise the question whether or not the `form-control` class introduced in BS3 is the ideal solution for supplying form controls with markup."
4,,
5,1,"I understand, and agree with, the motivation listed there, however, I currently feel the inconveniences of explicitly having to specify the class for every input element outweigh the advantages. For instance, does the reduced css size weigh against the increased size of html pages ?"

7,1,"The biggest inconvenience however becomes clear in **server-side (MVC) applications**, which typically use helper methods to create the sets of `form-group`s for properties of a given model. For instance, in ASP.NET MVC, using the `HtmlHelper.EditorFor()` method, it has become impossible to use the new Bootstrap 3 way of rendering form controls - it doesn't make sense to pass a class to the `EditorFor` method, because it might use a template consisting of all kinds of controls and other elements. The only solution is to create a custom version of this method which uses Bootstrap-specific templates (more or less what [TwitterBootstrapMvc](https://www.twitterbootstrapmvc.com/) is doing), or resort to Javascript to add the class to all input elements afterwards (as mentioned in [this SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18364255/twitter-bootstrap-3-text-inputs-in-mvc-razor-view-are-hiding-first-couple-char))."

9,1,"The [ASP.NET MVC5](http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-5/introduction/getting-started) template now comes bundled with Bootstrap 2, which is awesome, but I'm really wondering whether it'll be possible / desirable for them to support Bootstrap 3 - solely because of this unfortunate issue... I'm actually postponing integrating Bootstrap 3 into my ASP.NET MVC solutions, for this reason, which is very frustrating, because I'm very much looking forward to using its other features..."

11,1,"Is there any chance that for these reasons, this will be revised in a future version of Bootstrap, more like the way it was in Bootstrap 2, where input elements were styled implicitly (or maybe only when contained within a form using a specific class) ?"
