0,1,Is it possible to bind custom event to .select2-search-choice-close?
1,1,"I have connected select-2 plugin to my select element and now I would like to assign one event to it: to reload the form after clicking .select2-search-choice-close, but I'm unable to do it."
2,,
3,1,Before binding the event I have tried:
4,,
5,0,```
6,0,"$('.select2-choice').attr('href', '#'); // remove javascript:void(0)"
7,0,$('.select2-search-choice-close').off();
8,0,```
9,,
10,1,but still:
11,,
12,0,```
13,0,"$('#dashboard').on('click', '.select2-search-choice-close', function(e) {"
14,0,                    e.preventDefault();
15,0,                    alert('fjshdfkhsd');
16,0,                    console.log('fjshdfkhsd');
17,0,                };
18,0,```
19,,
20,1,none of this happen when I click .select2-search-choice-close.
