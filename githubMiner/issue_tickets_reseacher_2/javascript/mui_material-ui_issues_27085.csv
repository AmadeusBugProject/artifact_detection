0,1,[PaginationItem] Support custom icons
1,1,"Support custom icons for the `PaginationItem` `type`'s that display icons, namely `'next' | 'previous' | 'first' | 'last'`."
2,,
3,1,- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

5,1,## Summary ðŸ’¡
6,1,"The `PaginationItem` component has four internal icons that are displayed when `type = 'next' | 'previous' | 'first' | 'last'`, [see implementation here](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/8ca6103ccec5dc27340c186770d6d6828d3a450d/packages/material-ui/src/PaginationItem/PaginationItem.js#L285-L298). The icons displayed are internally defined and not customizable by a consumer. I believe they should be -- many other Mui components implement such a pattern."
7,,
8,1,"Examining past solutions, it seems that since there are more than two customizable icons, the prop should be a `components` slot based API as described / implemented #24017. I am happy to contribute a PR for this work, should it be approved."

39,1,## Motivation ðŸ”¦
40,,
41,1,I am trying to implement a custom theme for Mui according to my company's design system ([project here](https://github.com/prenda-school/prenda-spark)). The design system uses a custom icon set where the icons in question do not match.
