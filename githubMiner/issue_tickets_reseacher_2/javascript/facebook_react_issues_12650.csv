0,1,[Question] Marking html elements for testing
1,1,"Hi, i have part of component that renders like this: "
2,0,```jsx
3,0,return(
4,0,<div className={style.OuterWrapper}>
5,0,    <div
6,0,       className={style.Item}
7,0,       onClick={this.yesterdayFn}
8,0,       day='yesterday'
9,0,    >
10,0,       Yesterday
11,0,    </div>
12,0,    <div
13,0,      className={style.Item}
14,0,      onClick={this.todayFn}
15,0,      day='today'
16,0,    >
17,0,      Tomorrow
18,0,    </div>
19,0,    <div
20,0,      className={style.Item}
21,0,      onClick={this.tomorrowFn}
22,0,      day='tomorrow'
23,0,    >
24,0,      Today
25,0,    </div>
26,0,</div>
27,0,);
28,0,```

30,1,I'v been using `day` prop to find elements during testing with enzyme.
31,1,"Like this: `wrapper.find('day=[""today""]').simulate('click')` but I don't like it very much. Only other option that comes to my mind is for each clickable div make custom class name and search by class name."
32,,
33,1,"Search by text , function name or div position makes tests very fragile so I would like to avoid it."
34,,
35,1,How do you mark html elements for easy searching?
