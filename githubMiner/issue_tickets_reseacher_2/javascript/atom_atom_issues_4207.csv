0,1,No cancel option for Search All Files
1,1,"Hi,"
2,1,Thanks for great work.
3,1,"Here is one question. Since there is no cancel option for the search all files. If it searches the project files and the project is large, it's not possible to stop that. What I do now is that just ignore the ongoing search but type in another word to search all. Not sure if there is any side effect of this operation. Therefore, suggest to have option to cancel the on going search."
