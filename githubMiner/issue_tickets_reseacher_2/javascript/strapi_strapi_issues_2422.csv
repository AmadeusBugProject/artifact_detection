9,1,**What is the current behavior?**
10,1,"When I create a new entry, the beforeCreate method is fired. I already found out, that because of relations, a beforeUpdate is also fired in order to set relations on the newly inserted entry. But the model in that hook only includes the relation attributes"
11,,
12,1,**Steps to reproduce the problem**
13,1,1.  Use admin panel to create a new entry that has a relation
14,1,2. Check beforeUpdate hooks overgiven model.

16,1,**Suggested solutions**
17,1,"Always overgiving the ""whole"" model to the hooks."

Currently only ""afterSave"" gives me all attributes, but thats one event to late, because the dataset is already saved..."
