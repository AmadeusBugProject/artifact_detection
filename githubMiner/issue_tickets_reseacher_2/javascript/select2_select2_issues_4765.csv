0,1,Future plans?
1,1,"@kevin-brown  Are you still actively maintaining this project?  I noticed the last merge request was done about 26 days ago, together with a flurry of activity around that time.  It seems things have slowed down a bit in the last few months.  You mentioned somewhere that the project is not dead but rather in a slow release cycle.  Is this due to your schedule?  If so, would you be willing to assign a couple of project maintainers (seek for volunteers) that would carry your vision forward."

3,1,"Please don't take this as a ding but rather I am trying to see if can get some visibility into what your plan for future updates, etc.  I would hate for this project to go away (not saying that I will and I hope it does not)"
