0,1,Bug when using jQuery UI datepicker on Twitter bootstrap modal dialog
1,1,"I'm using Twitter bootstrap-modal along with jQuery UI datepicker. It's not a good choice, but I have to do that because jQuery UI has some features that bootstrap does not have."
2,0,
3,1,But there is a problem that user cannot focus on the year select box when creating a datepicker on a modal dialog.
4,0,
5,1,Here is the code to re-produce that bug:
6,1,## HTML
7,0,
8,0,``` html
9,0,"<link href=""http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">"
10,0,"<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.1/jquery-ui.js""></script>"
11,0,
12,0,"<div id=""my-dialog"" class=""modal hide fade"" tabindex=""-1"">"
13,0,"  <div class=""modal-header"">"
14,0,"    <button type=""button"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""modal"" aria-hidden=""true"">&times;</button>"
15,0,    <h3>Modal header</h3>
16,0,  </div>
17,0,
18,0,"  <div class=""modal-body"">"
19,0,    <p>Select date</p>
20,0,"    <input type=""text"" class=""date-picker"" />"
21,0,  </div>
22,0,"  <div class=""modal-footer"">"
23,0,"    <a href=""#"" class=""btn"">Close</a>"
24,0,"    <a href=""#"" class=""btn btn-primary"">Save changes</a>"
25,0,  </div>
26,0,</div>
27,0,```
28,1,## JS
29,0,
30,0,``` javascript
31,0,$(document).ready(function(){
32,0,  $('#my-dialog').modal('show');
33,0,  $('.date-picker').datepicker({
34,0,"    dateFormat: ""mm-dd-yy"","
35,0,"    yearRange: ""-10:+10"","
36,0,"    changeMonth: true,"
37,0,    changeYear: true
38,0,  });  
39,0,});
40,0,```
41,1,## My hot-fix
42,0,
43,1,"After walking through the code in https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-modal.js, I found the problem came from the `enforceFocus` method that will deny all focus actions on  elements that aren't contained in the modal dialog:"
44,0,
45,0,```
46,0,if (that.$element[0] !== e.target && !that.$element.has(e.target).length ...
47,0,```
48,0,
49,1,"And because the parent of jQuery datepicker is `body` tag, so the bug is there!"
50,1,I think this bug will also occur if we show some element on the modal by setting the absolute position and the element is outside the modal element.
51,0,
52,1,"I have to do some trick in bootstrap-modal to fix this issue. I changed the `enforceFocus` a bit, and added more methods to detect the focused element is on or intersect with the modal or not. Here is my code, not so good but it worked for me:"
53,0,
54,0,``` javascript
55,0,", enforceFocus: function () {"
56,0,  var that = this
57,0,"  $(document).on('focusin.modal', function (e) {"
58,0,    if (that.$element[0] !== e.target && !that.$element.has(e.target).length && 
59,0,"          !that.checkOverlap(that.$element, e.target)) { // I changed here"
60,0,      that.$element.focus()
61,0,    }
62,0,  })
63,0,}
64,0,
65,0,", getPositions: function (elem) {"
66,0,    var pos = $( elem ).offset();
67,0,    if(!pos)
68,0,      return null;
69,0,
70,0,    var width = $( elem ).width();
71,0,    var height = $( elem ).height();
72,0,"    return { left: pos.left, right: pos.left + width, top: pos.top, bottom: pos.top + height };"
73,0,}
74,0,
75,0,/**
76,0, * Check elem1 is overlapped by elem2 or not.
77,0, */
78,0,", checkOverlap: function ( elem1, elem2 ) {          "
79,0,    var pos1 = this.getPositions(elem1);
80,0,    var pos2 = this.getPositions(elem2);
81,0,
82,0,    if(!pos1 || !pos2)
83,0,      return false;
