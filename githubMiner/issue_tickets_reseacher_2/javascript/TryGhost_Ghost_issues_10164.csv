0,1,Ghost changes URL to lowercase (with a redirect)
1,1,"I'm using dynamic routing, and i have something like this:"
2,0,```
3,0,/about/team/:id/:
4,0,    data: page.about
5,0,    redirect: false
6,0,    template:
7,0,      - custom-team
8,0,```
9,1,The url is this: `/about/team/Z2lkOi8vdGVhbS9tZW1iZXIvMTcwMTg5Nzg5NjAyNQ==/`
10,1,Notice the :id has upper and lower case.
11,1,When loading the page it is transformed to: `/about/team/z2lkoi8vdgvhbs9tzw1izxivmtcwmtg5nzg5njaynq==/`
12,,
13,1,For whatever reason the pathname gets all lowercase. Is there a way to not make it lowercase?
14,,
15,1,"To answer my own question. Yes, Ghost does this. With uncapitalise.js"
16,1,But why?
17,,
18,1,Is there a way to add an option to the routes.yaml so it explicitly tells not to lowercase anything at that given URL?
19,,
20,1,I might do something with 3rd party APIs and I need to pass some case sensitive strings in the URL.
21,1,I think this is a problem with Ghost. It should not redirect to an all lowercase URL.
22,1,First I thought the browser was acting up. Then I checked on youtube and all worked fine (yes they have upper and lower case strings in the URL). So the only problem provider left was Ghost.
23,1,If you check in `uncapitalise.js` it has exceptions for signup and api related URLs.
24,1,Why? There is no logical reason for this.
25,,
26,1,It looks like a bug to me.
