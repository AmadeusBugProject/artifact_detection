0,1,[Bounty] [DatePicker] Allow selecting a date range
1,1,"Hi Everyone,"
2,,
3,1,This is related to to issue #1566 (Allow selecting a date range).
4,,
5,1,I have created a new issue here to track work on a bounty that I have added on Bountysource.
6,,
7,1,Initially I have added a $10 bounty for adding the ability to select multiple days on one datepicker.
8,,
9,1,Date Picker currently only allows selecting one date. This bounty will be awarded to the developer that creates a pull request to allow selecting a date range when the datepicker is opened.
10,,
11,1,The idea is that both a start and end date can be selected on the same calendar.
12,,
13,1,Something similar to:
14,0,- http://www.gpbl.org/react-day-picker/#examples/range
15,0,- http://projects.skratchdot.com/react-bootstrap-daterangepicker/
16,,
17,1,The pull request must be able to:
18,1,"- Click and drag a date range. (ie, select from the 1st to the 3rd in one click and drag motion)"
19,1,"- Allow selecting a date range by clicking on the first date, and then finally clicking on the second date (ie, the same as the links sent above)."
20,,
21,1,"Anyone else who wishes to also contribute to this functionality, feel free to add to the bounty on [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/27190193-bounty-datepicker-allow-selecting-a-date-range)."
