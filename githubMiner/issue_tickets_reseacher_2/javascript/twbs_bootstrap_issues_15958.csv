0,1,Media object and text-overflow in v3.3.2
1,1,I recently update my project from Bootstrap 3.2.x to 3.3.2 (last release) and I discover an important difference with the [Media Object](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#media) element.
2,,
3,1,I want to use in the media-heading the special less mixin .text-overflow() to add the following css attribute to the title :
4,,
5,0,```
6,0,.media-heading {
7,0,  overflow: hidden;
8,0,  text-overflow: ellipsis;
9,0,  white-space: nowrap;
10,0,}
11,0,```
12,,
13,1,"That works well (very well) in Bootstrap 3.2, you can see it in the following plnkr : [Media-List in 3.2](http://plnkr.co/edit/B7cGRbw8DxtnXgFhnmvM?p=preview)"
14,,
15,1,"But, since 3.3.x I can't use ellipsis and text-overflow inside header : [Media-List in 3.3.2](http://plnkr.co/edit/GAqClT8LZlSSSwduXEa0?p=preview)"

21,1,"It seems to be a regression, linked to the solution of #14990 "
22,1,"This behavior is very frustrating, especially on mobile device."
23,,
24,1,I've opened a question on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28660494/media-list-and-text-overflow-in-bootstrap-3-3-2) and the natural solution was to go back to the media-list css of version 3.2 (display : block and width : auto).

26,1,Thanks for your help.
