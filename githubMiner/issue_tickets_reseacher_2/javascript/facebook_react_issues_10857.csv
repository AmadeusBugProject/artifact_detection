0,1,toString on classname?
1,1,Did react used to call .toString() on non string objects it would receive?  A few packages are not working anymore and as far as I can tell this is likely the reason.  Specifically anything using `bem-cn` or similar.

3,1,Might be something to add to docs as a breaking change.

5,1,Can't figure out why else a few components are suddenly throwing errors and dont have any styles on them.
