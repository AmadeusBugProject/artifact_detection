0,1,Dynamic background color (callback)
1,1,"Hi there,"
2,,
3,1,"I got a case, where I need to dynamically set colors of single bars depending on the data value."
4,,
5,1,I would suggest to use a callback like this:
6,,
7,0,``` javascript
8,0,datasets: [{
9,0,"  label: '# of Votes',"
10,0,"  data: [ 10, 21, 22 ],"
11,0,  backgroundColor: function( value ) { // Callback instead of static color
12,0,    if ( value < 30 ) {
13,0,      return 'red';
14,0,    }
15,0,    return 'green';
16,0,  }
17,0,}]
18,0,```
