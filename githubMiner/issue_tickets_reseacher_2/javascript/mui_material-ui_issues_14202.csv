12,1,## Expected Behavior 🤔
13,,
14,1,We're looking at moving to using `@material-ui/system` instead of `styled-system` (at least when it's out of alpha). One of the API features that we use from [`styled-system`](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/packages/material-ui-system/src/sizing.js) that's missing is support for following syntax:
15,,
16,0,```jsx
17,0,<Box width={1/2} />
18,0,```
19,,
20,1,When mixing the `sizing` fn into `Box`.
21,,
22,1,Adding support for this would probably require a change to https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/packages/material-ui-system/src/sizing.js. Is this something you'd be interested in looking at / open to a pull request on?

24,1,## Current Behavior 😯
25,,
26,1,Currently only percentages are supported:
27,,
28,0,```jsx
29,0,"<Box width=""50%"" />"
30,0,```
31,,
32,1,## Examples 🌈
33,,
34,0,See: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/packages/material-ui-system/src/sizing.js
35,,
36,1,## Context 🔦
37,,
38,1,In many circumstances constructing percentage strings is more cumbersome than using `number` fractions (thinking particularly when constructing a grid).
