0,1,Dropdown menus do not close when called by JavaScript
1,1,Not sure whether this is a bug in the code or a bug in the documentation.
2,,
3,1,The  [usage documentation for Dropdown](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#dropdowns)  implies that one can programmatically invoke dropdowns via JavaScript instead of via including a data attribute.
4,,
5,1,"However, if one excludes the 'data-toggle=dropdown' and uses JavaScript such as '$("".data-toggle"").dropdown()', then the menus do not behave as expected. Opening a menu does not automatically close a previously opened menu."
6,,
7,1,To see the problem:
8,1,- Go to this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/xm8cK/
9,1,- In the Result pane click on the 'Dropdown' link
10,1,- Then click on the 'Dropdown 2' link.
11,,
12,1,Expected result:
13,1,"- When the 'Dropdown 2' menu opens, the 'Dropdown' menu closes"
14,,
15,1,Actual result:
16,1,"- When the 'Dropdown 2' menu opens, the 'Dropdown' menu remains open as well. All menus stay open until you ""click away"""
17,,
18,1,"(If this is by design, then the documentation in this section is misleading. I get the impression it is incomplete, regardless. E.g., the doc references 'data-toggle=dropdown' and gives an example, but the example does not use that attribute.)"
