0,1,React onChange events not bubbling up on unmount
1,1,**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
2,,
3,1,I'm reporting a bug.
4,,
5,1,**What is the current behavior?**
6,,
7,1,"When attaching an `onChange` handler to a JSX element, if calling this handler leads to the element being unmounted, then the `onChange` event never bubbles up in the DOM. This means you can't listen to it on the `document`, or basically on anything else than the element itself."
8,,
9,1,"**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**"
10,,
11,1,Example code here: https://codesandbox.io/s/qkr8j85z8j
12,1,Try it out here: https://qkr8j85z8j.codesandbox.io
13,,
14,1,Open the console and click around a bit. You will notice that the single checkbox that never changes it's position triggers both `onClick` and `onChange` listeners whereas the other checkboxes that get moved between lists only trigger `onClick` events.
15,,
16,1,**What is the expected behavior?**
17,,
18,1,I would expect the `onChange` event to be handled in the same way as the `onClick` event.
19,,
20,1,"**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**"

24,1,- MacOS 10.13.6
25,1,"- Opera 54, Firefox Dev Edition 62, Chrome Canary 70"
