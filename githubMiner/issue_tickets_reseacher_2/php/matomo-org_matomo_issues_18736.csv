1,1,## Current Behavior
2,1,"I rewrite the GET parameters of the tracking request via setCustomRequestProcessing(). However, I noticed that the page performance parameters (https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/tracking-api#optional-page-performancehttpsmatomoorgfaqhow-tohow-do-i-see-page-performance-reports-info) are not included there. They are added to the parameter string at a later time."

4,1,## Expected Behavior
5,1,"The description on https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/tracking-javascript for setCustomRequestProcessing() I understand so that the function is called directly before sending the request. Therefore, I expect all parameters to be included in it."
