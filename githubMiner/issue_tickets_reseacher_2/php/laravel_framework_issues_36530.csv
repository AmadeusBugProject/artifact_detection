2,1,<!-- Fill out the FULL versions with patch versions -->

8,1,### Description:
9,,
10,1,"When running tests with artisan (i.e. `artisan test`) and using configuration variables in a provider class, server variables set in `phpunit.xml` are not read. This also applies to parallel tests."
11,,
12,1,### Steps To Reproduce:
13,,
14,1,  1. Create a new Laravel app (`laravel new laratest`)
15,1,    a. Note the `.env` file has an `APP_ENV` value of `local`
16,1,    b. Note that the `phpunit.xml` file has an `APP_ENV` value of `testing`
17,1,  2. Dump the environment config value in the `AppServiceProvider`
18,,  
19,0,      ```php
20,0,      class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
21,0,      {
22,0,          public function register()
23,0,          {
24,0,               dd(config('app.env'));
25,0,          }
26,0,      }
27,0,      ```
28,,
29,1,  3. Run the raw test command (`vendor/bin/phpunit`)
30,1,    a. **The output will be `testing`** (expected)
31,1,  4. Run the test suite with artisan (`artisan test`)
32,1,    a. **The output will be `local`** (unexpected)
33,,
34,1,**NOTE:** This also affects methods that rely on these environment variables (e.g. `$app->environment()` and `$app->isRunningUnitTests()`)
35,,

38,1,### Additional Information
39,,
40,1,After doing some digging I was able to dump the raw command that is [passed to the `Symfony\Component\Process\Process` class](https://github.com/nunomaduro/collision/blob/a31c2c41f413940afd087d0961195a1af3d72f22/src/Adapters/Laravel/Commands/TestCommand.php#L85-L97) under the hood when running `artisan test`. On my system that was the following.
41,,
42,0,```
43,0,'/usr/bin/php7.4' 'vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit' '--configuration=/tmp/laratest/phpunit.xml' '--printer=NunoMaduro\Collision\Adapters\Phpunit\Printer'
44,0,```
45,,
46,1,Running this command worked as expected (output was `testing`).
