0,1,Allow encoded slashes in routes by default
1,1,Encoded slashes in route URLs are not allowed by default.
2,1,"A route for `/api/greet/{name}` will not be called if the request URL contains an URI-encoded slash (`%2F`), e.g. `/apps/testapp/api/greet/le%2Fon` will simply redirect to the default app while `/apps/testapp/api/greet/leon` works fine."
3,,
4,1,Workaround:
5,1,Specify a route `requirement` for `name`:
6,,
7,0,```
8,0,[
9,0,"	'name' => 'Api#greetNameEncoded',"
10,0,"	'url' => '/api/greet-encoded/{name}',"
11,0,"	'verb' => 'GET',"
12,0,	'requirements' => [
13,0,"		'apiVersion' => 'v1',"
14,0,"		'name' => '.+',"
15,0,"	],"
16,0,"],"
17,0,```
18,,
19,1,This however has the drawback that even unencoded slashes (`/`) are allowed.

21,1,Reproducible using the following test app: [testapp.tar.gz](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/files/2951835/testapp.tar.gz)
22,,
23,1,"- `/apps/testapp/api/greet/leon` returns `""Hello leon""` as expected"
24,1,"- `/apps/testapp/api/greet-encoded/leon` returns `""Hello leon""` as expected"
25,1,- `/apps/testapp/api/greet/le%2Fon` incorrectly redirects to the default app
26,1,"- `/apps/testapp/api/greet-encoded/le%2Fon` returns `""Hello le\/on""` as expected"
27,1,"- `/apps/testapp/api/greet-encoded/le/on` incorrectly returns `""Hello le\/on""`"
