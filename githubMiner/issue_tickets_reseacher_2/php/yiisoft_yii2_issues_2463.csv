0,1,Method find() not correctly handle the input parameters (MongoDB extension)
1,1,I'm trying to find the category by primary key:
2,,
3,0,``` php
4,0,$category = Category::find($cat_id);
5,0,```
6,,
7,1,If I use this ID the method find return my category.
8,,
9,0,``` php
10,0,$cat_id = new \MongoId('52ff69240bb6a8c2268b4567'); // correct MongoId
11,0,```
12,,
13,1,This value was received from $_GET request and result of the find method is successful.
14,,
15,0,``` php
16,0,$cat_id = '52ff69240bb6a8c2268b4567'; // incorrect value
17,0,// but it has been successfully processed and converted to MongoId object
18,0,```
19,,
20,1,"This value was also received from $_GET request, but i was specially modified it."
21,1,In this case I expect to get null value but got a MongoException.
22,,
23,0,``` php
24,0,$cat_id = 'abcd'; // will be thrown MongoException
25,0,```
26,,
27,1,I think that it would be better to change the method <b>ensureMongoId()</b>
28,0,https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/extensions/mongodb/Collection.php#L696
29,,
30,0,``` php
31,0,    protected function ensureMongoId($rawId)
32,0,    {
33,0,        ...
34,0,        ....
35,0,
36,0,        // try to get MongoId
37,0,        try {
38,0,            $rawId = new \MongoId($rawId);
39,0,        } catch (\Exception $e) {}
40,0,        return $rawId;
41,0,    }
42,0,```

44,1,Sorry for my bad English.
