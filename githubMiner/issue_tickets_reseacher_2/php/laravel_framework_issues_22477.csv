4,1,### Description
5,1,I'm generating resources for my api with apiResource and exceptions I define are being ignored.
6,,
7,1,Selected content of routes/api.php
8,0,`
9,0,"Route::apiResource('posts', 'PostController', ['except' => ['show']]);"
10,0,`
11,1,Selected output of  `php artisan route:list`
12,0,`
13,0,GET|HEAD | api/posts/{post} | posts.show | App\Http\Controllers\PostController@show | api
14,0,`
15,1,Not sure if this is a lacking feature or a bug.
16,,
17,1,### To reproduce.
18,1,Create a project
19,1,Generate a controller:
20,0,`
21,0,php artisan m:controller PostController
22,0,`
23,1,Create an api route for the controller in routes/api.php by adding the following code:
24,,`
25,0,"Route::apiResource('posts', 'PostController', ['except' => ['show']]);"
26,,`
27,1,For this app we don't want the specific show method hence we added an extra param called except which as stated [here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/controllers#restful-partial-resource-routes) should instruct laravel to ignore the specific one's we instruct it to ignore.
