0,1,PDO session storage and Oracle Database
1,1,There is a problem with this file:
2,,
3,0,https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/v2.0.9/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/SessionStorage/PdoSessionStorage.php
4,,
5,1,Specifically this function:
6,,
7,0,public function sessionRead($id)
8,,
9,1,I was getting an error using PDO session storage and Oracle DB:
10,,
11,0,"Warning: base64_decode() expects parameter 1 to be string, resource given in /usr/local/zend/apache2/htdocs/cokezero/vendor/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/SessionStorage/PdoSessionStorage.php line 186"
12,0,500 Internal Server Error - ErrorException
13,,
14,1,The problem is related to the way OCI8 retrieves LOBs data types.

18,1,"My hack to make it work, was to set an attribute and convert all datatypes to strings at fetching. Its not very elegant but works:"
19,,
20,0,"176             $this->db->setAttribute(\PDO::ATTR_STRINGIFY_FETCHES, true);"
21,0,177             $stmt = $this->db->prepare($sql);
22,0,"178             $stmt->bindParam(':id', $id, \PDO::PARAM_STR, 255);"
23,0,179
24,0,180             $stmt->execute();
25,0,181             // it is recommended to use fetchAll so that PDO can close the DB cursor
26,0,"182             // we anyway expect either no rows, or one row with one column. fetchColumn, seems to be buggy #4777"
27,0,183             $sessionRows = $stmt->fetchAll(\PDO::FETCH_NUM);
28,0,184
29,0,185             if (count($sessionRows) == 1) {
30,0,186                 return base64_decode($sessionRows[0][0]);
31,0,187             }
32,,
33,1,A better portable solution must be coded to retrieve the column sess_value correctly for oracle.
