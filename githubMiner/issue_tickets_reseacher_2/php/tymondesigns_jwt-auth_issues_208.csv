0,1,Uncaught TypeError: Illuminate\Exception\WhoopsDisplayer when hosted on Heroku
1,1,My set-up is as follows:
2,1,"- AngularJS front-end,"
3,1,"- Laravel back-end,"
4,1,"- hosted on Heroku (PHP 7, Apache 2.4.10)"
5,,
6,1,"I've been hosting a current project on Heroku for some time with no problems. Up until now I've been using Laravel's basic `Auth` quite successfully, and only recently decided to try out `JWT-Auth`. It works just fine on my local setup, but I just pushed my repo up to Heroku and disaster has struck!"
7,,
8,1,I get a `FatalErrorException` when trying to access any route:

10,0,```
11,0,"""Uncaught TypeError: Argument 1 passed to Illuminate\Exception\WhoopsDisplayer::display()"

17,,
18,1,"JWT-Auth extends **Illuminate\Exception**, of course, so it seems there is something wrong with the way JWT-Auth is handling the exceptions and passing them on to Illuminate."
19,,
20,1,I temporarily removed `JWT-Auth` and everything worked again. Any ideas?
21,,
22,1,"It works on my local machine, so my guess would be that I'm missing a dependency on my Heroku server."
