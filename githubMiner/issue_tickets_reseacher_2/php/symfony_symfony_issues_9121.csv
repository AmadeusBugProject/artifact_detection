0,1,[DomCrawler] Namespaces are no longer auto-registered
1,1,"After the recent changes in the handling of namespaces by the DomCrawler component, I'm getting a lot of errors in my unit tests."
2,,
3,1,Take for example the following HTML snippet:
4,,
5,0,``` html
6,0,<p>
7,0,    ...
8,0,"    <strong itemprop=""author"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person"">"
9,0,"        <i itemprop=""name"">...</i>"
10,0,    </strong>
11,0,    ...
12,0,</p>
13,0,```
14,,
15,1,This is the test I use to assert that the application is generating the correct metadata:
16,,
17,0,``` php
18,0,$this->assertEquals(
19,0,"    '...',"
20,0,"    $crawler->filter('strong[itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""] i[itemprop=""name""]')->text()"
21,0,);
22,0,```
23,,
24,1,"After the recent updates of the DomCrawler component, this test now generates the following error:"
25,,
26,0,```
27,0,"InvalidArgumentException: Could not find a namespace for the prefix: ""http"""
28,0,```
29,,
30,1,You can easily fix it by manually registering the _namespace_ with the following code:
31,,
32,0,``` php
33,0,"$crawler->registerNamespace('http', '');"
34,0,$this->assertEquals(
35,0,"    '...',"
36,0,"    $crawler->filter('strong[itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""] i[itemprop=""name""]')->text()"
37,0,);
38,0,```
39,,
40,1,"The problem is that you must also manually register any namespace used by the page, such as `fb` (for `fb:page_id`, `fb:app_id`, etc.) and `og` (for `og:image`, etc.)"
41,,
42,1,"Reading the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/symfony/DomCrawler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) of the component I can't see any BC-break related to this, so I don't know if I'm doing something wrong of this is the new behavior of the component and it's still not documented."
