0,1,Extending Yii2: Namespace naming guidelines
1,1,We need a decision about the guidelines for using namespaces in Yii extensions.
2,,
3,1,There are several extensions already under development and I'd really like to get that stared in a clean way. Because everyone is doing it different at the moment :(
4,1,### Introduction

6,1,It was discussed here:
7,0,- http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php/topic/46182-better-support-for-extensions-with-yii-2/page__view__findpost__p__217993

17,1,@samdark: I created a PR about this topic for the wiki once. I think the github wiki should be completely transferred to the docs.
18,1,### Proposal (tl;dr)
19,,
20,1,I suggest to add these rules:
21,1,- Yii2 extensions MUST use the type `yii2-extension` composer.json file
22,1,- Yii2 extensions MUST NOT use `yii` or `yii2` in the composer package name or in the namespaces used in the package
23,1,- Yii2 extensions SHOULD use namespaces in this format `vendor-name\package` (all lowercase)
24,1,- Yii2 extensions MAY use a `yii2-` prefix in the composer vendor name (URL)
25,1,- Yii2 extensions MAY use a `yii2-` prefix in the repository name (URL)
