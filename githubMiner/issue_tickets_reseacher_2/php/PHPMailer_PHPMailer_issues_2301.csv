1,1,"Hello, If I am missing anything apologies (maybe this is wordpress issue not adjusting to PHPMailer) but it looks like there might be an issue with a condition in the mailSend function on line 1864 (or there about's). The first condition to set the Sender attribute:"

4,0,            $this->Sender = $this->From;
5,0,        }
6,,
7,1,"Will not trigger the below checks to add the ""-f"" flag to the start of the sender string, which will cause the mailer to fail should your MTA require a valid from sender. (copied logic below for context)...in fact it looks like the below will never run if Sender is empty and From is defined never adding the -f option. "
