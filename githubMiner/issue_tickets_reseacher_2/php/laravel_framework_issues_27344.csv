5,1,### Description:
6,1,"When you add a route to a controller function that does not exist, laravel throws a `ReflectionException` instead of a `BadMethodCallException`. The exception says that the function `()` does not exist."

10,1,### Steps To Reproduce:
11,1,1. Edit your `web.php` file like this (does not happen when you pass the controller and function as string)
12,0,```
13,0,"Route::get('/test', [TestController::class, 'index']);"
14,0,```
15,,
16,1,2. Create the `TestController` but don't create function `index`
17,0,```
18,0,<?php
19,,
20,0,namespace App\Http\Controllers;
21,,
22,0,use Illuminate\Http\Request;
23,,
24,0,class TestController extends Controller
25,0,{
26,0,    //
27,0,}
28,0,```
29,1,3. Visit the new route
30,,
31,1,Expected behaviour would be that laravel tells which function does not exist.
