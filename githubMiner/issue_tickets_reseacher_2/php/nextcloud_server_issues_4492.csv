1,1,"I want to use ""draw.io"" with nextcloud.  Draw.io [supplies some code to allow you to edit diagrams from WebDAV](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-webdav).  It is trivial to unpack the source on a WebDAV server and run it.  My problem is with nextcloud.  It requires a lot of bootstrap code just to host a SPA with no backend code.  The simplest thing in my mind would be to allow for a specific folder to be ""published"" where it will serve that content like a normal static webserver.  I have not gotten it to work properly, but I _think_ I can emulate this behavior via the ""remote.php"" script, but the code looks messy and doesn't integrate nicely from the nextcloud menu.  Any ideas on this?"
