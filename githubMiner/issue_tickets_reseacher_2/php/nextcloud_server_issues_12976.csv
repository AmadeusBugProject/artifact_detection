0,0,occ db:convert-filecache-bigint not possible in automatic instances
1,,
2,,
3,1,### What is going wrong?
4,1,Since i implemented NC 15.0.0 in my Dockerfile. it shows the following message:
5,,
6,0,> Some columns in the database are missing a conversion to big int. Due to the fact that changing column types on big tables could take some time they were not changed automatically. By running 'occ db:convert-filecache-bigint' those pending changes could be applied manually. This operation needs to be made while the instance is offline. For further details read the documentation page about this.
7,0,> filecache.mtime
8,0,> filecache.storage_mtime
9,,
10,1,It can be converted by:
11,0,`sudo -u www-data php occ db:convert-filecache-bigint`
12,,
13,1,BUT you have to accept this manually. So for automatism it is NOT usable. And my instances are created automatically.
14,,
