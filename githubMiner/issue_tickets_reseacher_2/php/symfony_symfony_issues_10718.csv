0,1,Instantiate `PropertyAccessor` by specifying `&$objectOrArray`
1,1,Morning!
2,,
3,1,I wonder if it would be better to instantiate the `PropertyAccessor` with the `$object` we want to get or set property values on.
4,,
5,1,"This way, we can reflect on the `$object` on `PropertyAccessor` initialization or within a `for` method (`$pA->for($object)`), and have the list of its getters, setters, hassers, issers cached somewhere inside the `PropertyAccessor` object?"
6,,
7,1,"It will have shorter `setValue` and `getValue` methods, without the need of passing every time the `&$objectOrArray` argument."
8,,
9,1,And it would probably have better performance.
10,,
11,1,Thanks anyways for the great components and framework!
