1,1,"This issue #38792 is still persisting when you have installed Messenger with Symfony Serializer and  [FOSRestBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/blob/3.x/Resources/config/exception.xml#L24) as it also have a [FlatExceptionNormalizer](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/blob/3.x/Serializer/Normalizer/FlattenExceptionNormalizer.php#L24) with higher priority that support only normalization, and when your messenger handler throw an exceptions it's get normalized by FOS FlatExceptionNormalizer and denormalized by Messenger FlatExceptionNormalizer that throw this Exception."

3,1,Maybe change Messenger FlatExceptionNormalizer [priority](https://github.com/symfony/framework-bundle/blob/5.x/Resources/config/messenger.php#L70) or aware people that if they use FOSRestBundle they should change default priority of this normalizer?
