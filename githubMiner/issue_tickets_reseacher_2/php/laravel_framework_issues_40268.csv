8,1,### Description:
9,1,"When calling a method during a saving event, the attribute is marked as dirty, which results in a wrong query:"
10,0,```sql
11,0,1054 Unknown column 'bar' in 'field list'
12,0,```
13,, 
14,1,With the old Mutators/Accessors the attribute is not marked as dirty and the query runs just fine.
15,,
16,1,### Steps To Reproduce:
17,1,Create a method that calls the accessor.
18,1,For example:
19,0,```php
20,0,protected function bar(): Attribute
21,0,{
22,0,    return new Attribute(
23,0,"        get: fn () => 1,"
24,0,    );
25,0,}
26,,
27,0,public function foo()
28,0,{
29,0,    return $this->bar;
30,0,}
31,0,```
32,,
33,1,Call foo() in the saving event in the model for example:
34,0,```php
35,0,public static function boot()
36,0,{
37,0,    static::saving(function ($model) {
38,0,        $model->foo();
39,0,    }
40,0,}
41,0,```
42,,
43,1,Save the model to trigger the event:
44,0,```php
45,0,$model->update(['something' => true]);
46,0,```
