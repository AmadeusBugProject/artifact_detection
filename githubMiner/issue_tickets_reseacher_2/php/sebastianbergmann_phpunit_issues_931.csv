0,1,Neither PEAR nor Composer can install PHPUnit
1,1,### Issue 1: Composer
2,0,
3,1,"When trying to use Composer to load PHPUnit, a ""could not be found"" error is returned."
4,0,
5,1,Here's what `composer.json` looks like:
6,0,
7,0,```
8,0,{
9,0,"    ""require-dev"": {"
10,0,"        ""phpunit/phpunit"": ""3.8.*"""
11,0,"    },"
12,0,"    ""require"": {"
13,0,"        ""slim/slim"": ""2.*"""
14,0,    }
15,0,}
16,0,```
17,0,
18,1,PHPUnit has not been downloaded in this directory. I attempted to update using:
19,0,
20,0,```
21,0,php composer.phar update
22,0,```
23,0,
24,1,This fails with the following message:
