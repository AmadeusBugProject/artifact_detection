0,1,How to replace the 3rd party dependency
1,1,My `composer.json`:
2,,
3,0,```json
4,0,{
5,0,"  ""require-dev"": {"
6,0,"    ""guzzlehttp/guzzle"": ""5.3.x-dev as 5.0.0"","
7,0,"    ""aeris/guzzle-http-mock"": "">=1.1.5"""
8,0,  }
9,0,}
10,0,```
11,,
12,1,I'm trying to replace requirement for `guzzlehttp/guzzle` (required by `aeris/guzzle-http-mock`)  and use `5.3.x-dev` version instead of `5.0.0`.
13,,
14,1,"Also I've tried to use `replace` section, e.g."
15,,
16,0,```
17,0,"  ""replace"": {"
18,0,"    ""guzzlehttp/guzzle"": ""5.3.x-dev"""
19,0,  }
20,0,```
21,,
22,1,However I've got still the following error:
23,,
24,0,```
25,0,  Problem 1
26,0,    - aeris/guzzle-http-mock 1.1.5 requires guzzlehttp/guzzle ~5.0.0 -> no matching package found.
27,0,    - aeris/guzzle-http-mock 1.1.5 requires guzzlehttp/guzzle ~5.0.0 -> no matching package found.
28,0,    - Installation request for aeris/guzzle-http-mock 1.1.5 -> satisfiable by aeris/guzzle-http-mock[1.1.5].
29,0,```
30,,
31,1,Is it possible to achieve the above? To replace the version provided by `composer.json` hosted on _packagist_?
