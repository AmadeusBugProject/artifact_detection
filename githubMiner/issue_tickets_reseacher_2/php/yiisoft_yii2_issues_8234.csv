0,1,"TimestampBehavior do not insert proper time in database, and customizing how it does do not work ( as per guide instructions )"
1,1,I have created_at and updated_at fields in my table. I am using TimestampBehavior in my model:
2,,
3,0,`public function behaviors()`
4,0,`{`
5,0,    `return [`
6,0,"        `TimestampBehavior::className(),`"
7,0,    `];`
8,0,`}`
9,,
10,1,When I insert or update a record with AR I can see that time output is 2 hours behind the real one.
11,1,For example it says that update time of some record ( 'updated_at:dateTime' ) is 8:33 but it is 10:33.
12,,
13,1,Then I found instructions here: http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/yii-behaviors-timestampbehavior.html about how to customize the way the timestamp is calcualted. When I put this code in my model:
14,,
15,0,`public function behaviors()`
16,0,`{`
17,0,    `return [`
18,0,        `[`
19,0,"            `'class' => TimestampBehavior::className(),`"
20,0,"            `'createdAtAttribute' => 'create_time',`"
21,0,"            `'updatedAtAttribute' => 'update_time',`"
22,0,"            `'value' => new Expression('NOW()'),`"
23,0,"        `],`"
24,0,    `];`
25,0,`}`
26,,
27,1,I get this error :
28,,
29,0,`ReflectionException
30,0,Class created_at does not exist`
31,,
32,1,If I remove created and updatedAtAttribute I will get this error:
33,,
34,0,`Invalid Configuration â€“ yii\base\InvalidConfigException
35,0,Unsupported configuration type: object`
36,,
37,1,Is this a bug ? Or maybe you know what may be the problem ? I am using yii 2.0.3
