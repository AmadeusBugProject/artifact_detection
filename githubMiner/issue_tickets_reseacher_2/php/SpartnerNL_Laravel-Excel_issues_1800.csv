37,1,"Trailing zeroes are being removed from my columns. I have looked into this and it seems the fix is to use TYPE_STRING on the column. I am currently using the exportable format (with WithColumnFormatting, WithHeadings, WithMapping) but I can't find a concern that will allow me to set the DataType of the columns/cells. Is this currently possible? or do I need to access the underlying library directly?"
