0,1,MsgHTML() and IsHTML() + Body fail silently without enclosing HTML and BODY tags
1,1,"Hi folks,"
2,,
3,1,I've noticed that both
4,,
5,0,$mail->MsgHTML($body);
6,,
7,1,and
8,,
9,0,$mail->IsHTML(true);
10,0,$mail->Body = $body;
11,,
12,1,"will fail to send an email without throwing an error if $body does not begin and end with the appropriate HTML and BODY tags.  I'm not sure if this is a bug or if it should be a requested feature (or if I should just format my HTML emails appropriately), but I've seen a few people trying to figure out what's going on, so I thought I'd throw it out there."
