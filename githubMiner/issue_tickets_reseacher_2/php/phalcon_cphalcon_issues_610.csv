0,1,Routing is not working via annotations
1,1,"Hi,"
2,,
3,1,There is a problem with the routing written via annotations. Let me show an example. (please see the comments in the code)
4,,
5,0,``` php
6,0,/**
7,0,"  * @RoutePrefix(""/users"")"
8,0,  */
9,0,class Users extends BaseController
10,0,{
11,0,    /**
12,0,      * @Get('/')
13,0,      */
14,0,    public function indexAction()
15,0,    {
16,0,        echo 'Hello world'; //works perfect!!!
17,0,    }
18,,
19,,
20,0,    /**
21,0,"      * @Route('/users/{id:[0-9]+}', methods=""GET"", name=""users-view"")"
22,0,      */
23,0,    public function viewAction($id)
24,0,    {
25,0,        echo $id; // Don't work via '/users/100' URL. But it works perfect via /users/view/100
26,0,    }
27,0,}
28,0,```
