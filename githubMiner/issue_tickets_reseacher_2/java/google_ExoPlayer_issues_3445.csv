0,1,freescale video decoder need output surface workaround
1,1,Hi:
2,1,"When I run gts test with on android board with freescale decoder, i found that MediaCodec#setOutputSurface will cause that video decoder could not dequeue buffer from surface."

6,1,the test will call MediaCodec#setOutputSurface twice.
7,1,as freescale decoder do not support storingMetadataInDecodedBuffers()
8,1,all output buffers of decoder are allocated from the surface when ACodec::configureCodec() called.
9,1,"each time ACodec::handleSetSurface called, it will attach all buffers to the new surface."
10,1,"when setSurface called the first time, all buffers are attached to Dummy surface."
11,1,"when it called the second time, all buffers should be attached from dummy surface to playback surface."
12,1,"however, this operation is cross-compile and graphic buffer handle changed after Surface::attachBuffer() called. Then the graphic handle dequeued from native window is not equal to previous handle that attached."
13,1,and ACodec could not get any surface buffer to queue into decoder component.
14,,
15,1,I checkout to dev-v2 branch and found a function named codecNeedsSetOutputSurfaceWorkaround() in MediaCodecVideoRenderer.java
16,1,"qualcomm and MTK have added their decoder name to the function, then they can skip the test."
17,1,Please add freescale decoder name to that function. These decoders have same behavior on any product model.
