7,1,3. use DefaultDataSource or CacheDataSource to load the data.
8,1,- Result:
9,1,1. if I use DefaultDataSource:
10,0,```
11,0,"DataSource.Factory dataSourceFactory = new DefaultDataSourceFactory(this, BANDWIDTH_METER,"
12,0,"                new OkHttpDataSourceFactory(getOkHttpClient(), getUa(), BANDWIDTH_METER));"
13,0,"return new HlsMediaSource(uri, dataSourceFactory, mainHandler, eventLogger);"
14,0,```
15,1,the ParsingLoadable will use datasource's uri:
16,0," `result = parser.parse(dataSource.getUri(), inputStream);`"
17,1,"exoplayer will correctly use URL2's host ""B"" to join the ts segment url."
18,1,"2. if I use CacheDataSource, however,exoplayer will use URL1's host ""A"", which is wrong, the response code will be 404:"
19,0,```
20,0, CacheEvictor cacheEvictor = new LeastRecentlyUsedCacheEvictor(100 * 1024 * 1024);
21,0,"        Cache cache = new SimpleCache(new File(getExternalCacheDir(), ""media_cache""), cacheEvictor);"
22,0,"        DataSource.Factory upstreamFactory = new OkHttpDataSourceFactory(getOkHttpClient(), getUa(), BANDWIDTH_METER);"

24,0,"return new HlsMediaSource(uri, dataSourceFactory, mainHandler, eventLogger);"
25,0,```

27,1,"The reason is, DefaultDataSource.getUri() calls OkHttpDataSource.getUri(), which handle 302 correctly.But CacheDataSource.getUri() will just return the original uri, which is wrong."
