0,1,Wrong DDL if Package/function is created in non-default schema
1,1,#### System information:
2,1,- Operating system (distribution) and version Win10
3,1,- DBeaver version 7.2.0 EA
4,,
5,1,#### Connection specification:
6,1,- Database name and version Oracle
7,,
8,1,"#### Steps to reproduce, if exist:"
9,1,1. Set a schema as default (e.g. TESTAS)
10,1,2. Create a procedure in non-default schema (e.g. in HR):
11,1,e.g.
12,0,```sql
13,0,CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE HR.TEST
14,0,  (  p_emp_id          job_history.employee_id%type
15,0,"   , p_start_date      job_history.start_date%type"
16,0,"   , p_end_date        job_history.end_date%type"
17,0,"   , p_job_id          job_history.job_id%type"
18,0,"   , p_department_id   job_history.department_id%type"
19,0,   )
20,0,IS
21,0,BEGIN
22,0,"  INSERT INTO job_history (employee_id, start_date, end_date,"
23,0,"                           job_id, department_id)"
24,0,"    VALUES(p_emp_id, p_start_date, p_end_date, p_job_id, p_department_id);"
25,0,END TEST;
26,0,```
27,1,Actual result: Default schema appears at the end of DDL:
28,0,```sql
29,0,ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA=**HR**;
30,0,CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE HR.TEST
31,0,  (  p_emp_id          job_history.employee_id%type
32,0,"   , p_start_date      job_history.start_date%type"
33,0,"   , p_end_date        job_history.end_date%type"
34,0,"   , p_job_id          job_history.job_id%type"
35,0,"   , p_department_id   job_history.department_id%type"
36,0,   )
37,0,IS
38,0,BEGIN
39,0,"  INSERT INTO job_history (employee_id, start_date, end_date,"
40,0,"                           job_id, department_id)"
41,0,"    VALUES(p_emp_id, p_start_date, p_end_date, p_job_id, p_department_id);"
42,0,END TEST;
43,0,ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA=**TESTAS**;
44,0,```
