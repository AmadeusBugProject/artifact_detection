0,1,[native-image] Netty with native EPoll support
1,1,I'm trying to build a native image for netty / Vert.x which makes use of the native EPoll library (`netty-transport-native-epoll`).
2,,
3,1,The image generation is however failing with error:
4,0,> Error: Must not have a started Thread in the image heap.

9,1,I think this is similar to the error in this issue:
10,0,https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/365
11,,
12,1,A very basic reproducer can be found in the netty-native-epoll branch:
13,0,https://github.com/Jotschi/vertx-graalvm-native-image-test/tree/netty-native-epoll
14,,
15,1,Native Libs are for linux-amd64 only.
16,,
17,1,I'm not sure how the JNIConfigurationFiles should actually be used. I added the native classes and all native methods. Let me know whether this is actually needed.
