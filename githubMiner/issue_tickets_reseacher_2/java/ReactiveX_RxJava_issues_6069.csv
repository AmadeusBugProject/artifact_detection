6,1,I believe `viewToDocSubject.value` cannot be null:
7,,  
8,0,```
9,0,private val viewportSubject = BehaviorSubject.createDefault(someDoubleValue)
10,,
11,0,var viewToDoc: Double
12,0,"    get() = viewToDocSubject.value // required Double, found Double?"
13,0,```
14,,
15,1,I got this error after upgrading from `2.1.0`
16,1,Is this by design? am I missing something?
