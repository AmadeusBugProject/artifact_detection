0,1,Views on Columnar Table
1,1,Question on the way views and column selection work... Given I created this view:
2,,
3,0,CREATE VIEW myview AS
4,0,SELECT
5,0,"col1, col2, col3, table2.prop1, table2.prop2"
6,0,"sum(val4) as col4, sum(val5) as col5  "
7,0,"FROM table1_columnar, table2"
8,0,WHERE table1_columnar.someid = table2.someid
9,0,"GROUP BY col1, col2, col3, table2.prop1, table2.prop2"
10,,
11,1,"If I run the query shown below, will the view still process col2, col3, col4, & prop2 every time? "
12,,
13,0,"SELECT col1, prop1, sum(col5) FROM myview GROUP BY col1, prop1;"
14,,
15,1,This is only a simple example with a few columns but I wanted to know if views could leverage the columnar structure and performance by excluding certain columns if they were not actually being selected (without having to create many subset views)?
16,,
17,1,Thanks!
