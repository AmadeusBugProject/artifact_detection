0,1,Issue with Mockito and JpaRepository
1,1,"Hello,"
2,,
3,1,I don't know if this an issue with Spring boot data JPA or with Mockito but I encountered a strange behaviour.
4,1,"I create 2 Controller. In the first, I inject a Service. In the second, I inject a JpaRepository."
5,,
6,1,Now I create UnitTests for both this Controller.
7,1,"For the second Controller, I mock the Repository. Everything works fine."
8,1,"For the first Controller, I mock the Service. The test fail."
9,1,It seems to search to inject the Repository whereas it is not used in this Controller.
10,,
11,1,I create a very simple project to reproduce this behavior :
12,0,https://github.com/YLombardi/mockito-spring-jpa-issue

14,1,Is it my test that is wrong or a bug ?
