23,1,**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:
24,1,`gcs-repository` snapshot creation times out systematically after 20-30 mins with 1-2 shards of 63 not being snapshot correctly. It is not always the same index/shards that fail.
25,,
26,1,Repository configuration looks like:
27,0,```
28,0,{
29,0,"  ""type"": ""gcs"","
30,0,"  ""settings"": {"
31,0,"    ""bucket"": ""backup.<replaced>.com"","
32,0,"    ""service_account"": ""_default_"","
33,0,"    ""base_path"": ""elasticsearch/snapshots-v5"","
34,0,"    ""compress"": ""true"","
35,0,"    ""max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec"": ""100mb"""
36,0,  }
37,0,}
38,0,```
39,,
40,1,"We never encountered this issue with filesystem-type snapshots. Total data size is ~180GB for 63 primary shards. We are not network bound when creating the snapshot. I am not sure the `max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec` value is taken into account for GCS snapshot creation but we are far from the 100mb/sec, typically between 20-40mb/sec. The cluster is typically not under heavy load at the time of snapshotting."
