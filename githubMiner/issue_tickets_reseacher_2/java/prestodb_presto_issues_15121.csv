0,1,Cannot access worker page from Query Details Page
1,1,"The Stages section of the Query Details page (corresponding to ""execute statement1"") shows the stages of the execution and for each it shows how the work was allocated throughout several workers."
2,1,These workers are currently showing their IP under the Host column (not their IDs). When I click on the IP it is sending me to an invalid URL: /ui/worker.html?undefined

4,1,If I replace the 'undefined' above with the worker id I get the page to load properly with the worker stats.

6,1,Haven't been able to find any information online if this could be some missing configuration or not... I used the Deploying Presto guide to create the cluster and it seems to be running smoothly.
