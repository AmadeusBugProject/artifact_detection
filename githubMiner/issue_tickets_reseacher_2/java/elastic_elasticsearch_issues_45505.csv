33,1,**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:
34,1,as described here https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-synonym-tokenfilter.html it should be possible to reload `synonym` and `synonym_graph` filters. Running the example provided it does as expected with `synonym` filter but if we change it to `synonym_graph` nothing is reloaded

36,1,**Steps to reproduce**:

38,1,"Please include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including"
39,1,"(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for"
40,1,"us to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it."
41,,
42,1, 1. run the example at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-synonym-tokenfilter.html
43,1, 2. verify that the response states that the `synonym` filter was reloaded
44,1, 3. delete the index and change the `synonym` filter to `synonym_graph` filter and run the example again
45,1,4. run `_reload_search_analyzers`. See that nothing was reloaded
