0,1,Locking in NodeEnvironment is completely broken
1,1,"after the lucene 5.3 upgrade, i looked at how ES uses lucene's filesystem locking. most places are ok, obtaining a lock and doing stuff in a try/finally. However NodeEnvironment is a totally different story. Can we fix the use of locking here?"
2,1,1. `deleteShardDirectorySafe` is anything but safe. it calls `deleteShardDirectoryUnderLock` which doesn't actually delete under a lock either!!!! It calls this bogus method: `acquireFSLockForPaths` which acquires _then releases_ locks. Why? Why? Why?
3,1,"2. `assertEnvIsLocked` is only called under assert. why? Look at `findAllIndices`, its about to do something really expensive, why can't the call to `ensureValid` be a real check?"
4,1,"3. `assertEnvIsLocked` has a bunch of leniency, why in the hell would it return `true` when closed or when there are no locks at all, thats broken."
5,,
6,1,"After this stuff is fixed, any places here doing heavy operations (e.g. N filesystem operations) should seriously consider calling `ensureValid` on any locks that are supposed to be held. It means you do N+1 operations or whatever but man, if what we are doing is not important, then why are we using fs locks?"
