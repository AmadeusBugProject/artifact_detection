0,1,MatchQueryParser doesn't allow field boosting on query when included in a _GET request
1,1,"In the following query, we try to boost the FirstLast field by 7 and it fails:"
2,,
3,0,"/_search?q=(FirstLast%3A""johnsmith"")^7&explain=true"
4,0,...
5,0,"_explanation"": {"
6,,
7,0,```
8,0,"""value"": 10,"
9,0,"""description"": ""weight(FirstLast:johnsmith in 0) [PerFieldSimilarity], result of:"""
10,0,```
11,,
12,1,This behavior works correctly in the MultiMatchQueryParser:
13,0,"_search?q=(FirstLast%3A""johnsmith"")^7+(State%3A""wa"")&explain=true"
14,0,...
15,0,"""_explanation"": {"
16,,
17,0,```
18,0,"""value"": 80,"
19,0,"""description"": ""sum of:"","
20,0,"""details"": ["
21,0,    {
22,0,"        ""value"": 70,"
23,0,"        ""description"": ""weight(FirstLast:johnsmith^7.0 in 0) [PerFieldSimilarity], result of:"","
24,0,```
25,,
26,1,Note that the boost does work when the request is a _POST as so:
27,0,"_search"" -d '{""query"":{""term"":{""State"":{""value"":""wa"",""boost"":7.0}}}}'"
28,0,"{""took"":2,""timed_out"":false,""_shards"":{""total"":1,""successful"":1,""failed"":0},""hits"":{""total"":1,""max_score"":70.0,""hits"":[{""_index"":""3"",""_type"":""people"",""_id"":""XXXXXXXXXX"",""_score"":70.0, ""_source"" : {""FirstLast"":[""johnsmith""],""State"":[""wa""]}}]}}"

30,1,I'm just getting used to the code and have no debugger setup yet so forgive me if I'm mistaken or incorrectly using this.
