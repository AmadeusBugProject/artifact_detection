0,1,Does RecordReaderDataSetIterator support multilabel classification datasets
1,1,"Could you please tell if `RecordReaderDataSetIterator` could generate multilabel classification datasets, and if not, what's the way to go?"
2,,
3,1,"Also, the [RecordReaderDataSetIterator.java#L119](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/d6d913a8613060efccecb1911920cced4ea9d0a3/deeplearning4j-core/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/datasets/datavec/RecordReaderDataSetIterator.java#L119) seems to set labelIndexTo to the same value as labelindexFrom, regardless of the number of possible labels. Is this intentional?"
