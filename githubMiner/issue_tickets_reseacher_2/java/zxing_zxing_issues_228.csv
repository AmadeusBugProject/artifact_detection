0,1,code128c doesn't write checksum
1,1,Given the following:
2,,
3,0,``` scala
4,0,    val writer = new MultiFormatWriter()
5,0,"    val matrix = writer.encode(""123456789"", BarcodeFormat.CODE_128, 400, 100)"
6,0,    val out = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
7,0,"    MatrixToImageWriter.writeToStream(matrix, ""PNG"", out)"
8,0,    out.toByteArray
9,0,```
10,,
11,1,The outputted barcode doesn't contain the checksum. Once scanned back in the checksum doesn't appear.
12,,
13,1,In fact this might be as simple as the checksum is not meant to appear.
