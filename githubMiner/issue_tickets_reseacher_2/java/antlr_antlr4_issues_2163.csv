10,1,"The jar files (particularly for the runtime) should contain `Automatic-Module-Name` entries so that modular JDK 9 projects have a stable name to use in module `requires` clauses. I'd suggest `org.antlr.antlr4.runtime` as this is close to what you're already using as the OSGi symbolic name, but with the hyphen replaced with a dot (module names at the language level can't contain hyphens)."
