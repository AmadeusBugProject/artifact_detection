0,1,selenium-standalone-server will use network interfaces that are down when registering as a node
1,1,## Meta -
2,,
3,1,OS:
4,1,Linux 4.7.6 (ArchLinux)(node machine) and CentOS 6 (hub machine)
5,,
6,1,Selenium Version:
7,0,3.0.0
8,1,## Steps to reproduce -
9,,
10,1,you should already have one network interface on your system that is UP and has an IP address
11,1,add another ipv4 network interface on your system and give it an IP address:
12,,
13,0,> $ modprobe dummy
14,0,> $ ip link set name eth10 dev dummy0
15,0,> $ ip addr add 192.168.100.199/24 brd + dev eth10
16,,
17,1,"by deafault, this interface will be DOWN"
18,1,start selenium-standalone-server in hub mode
19,1,start another selenium-standalone-server in node mode
20,1,## Expected Behavior -
21,,
22,1,The hub should show a connection from the IP address of the network interface that is UP
23,1,## Actual Behavior -
24,,
25,1,The dummy interface will be used to connect to the hub. You should see it register a node from 192.168.100.199
26,,
27,1,"The first network interface that is returned from java.net.NetworkInterface#getNetworkInterfaces that is not the loopback interface will be used, regardless of the status of that interface. I myself have a setup at work where I use extra interfaces for some virtualbox VMs that our dev environments run in. I'm unable to run a selenium node from my machine, even if these interfaces are DOWN."
