0,1,some confuse about setTimer
1,1,"recently such a problem came to me,I write my code like this:"
2,0,public void test(){
3,0,"vertx.setTimer(10000,handle -> {"
4,0,try{
5,0,// do something;
6,0,test();
7,0,} catch(e){
8,0,test();
9,0,}
10,0,});
11,0,}
12,1,but amazingly I found that the timer would exit after it work for several times. Do anyone know why? Thanks a lot.
