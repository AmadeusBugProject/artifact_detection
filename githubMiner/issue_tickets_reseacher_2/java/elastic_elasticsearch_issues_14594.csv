0,1,Field names cannot contain the . character in Elasticsearch 2.0
1,1,Starting with Elasticsearch 2.0 field names can not contain the `.` character anymore.
2,,
3,1,I like to use `.` as separator in field names while using `_` instead of camel casing - i.e. `docker.label.some_stuff` instead of `docker_label_some_stuff` since it makes the parsing much easier.
4,,
5,1,Any chance field names with a `.` will be allowed in Elasticsearch 2.x?
