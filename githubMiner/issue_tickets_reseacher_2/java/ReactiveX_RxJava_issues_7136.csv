0,1,Flaky Test 3x
1,1,"Hello, we are a group of researchers interested in understanding methods to reduce costs associated with Test Flakiness [1]. We developed an approach to detect flaky tests, dubbed Shaker [2]. Shaker spawns stressor tasks in the running environment (e.g., tasks that consume lots of cpu or memory) to identify if perturbations can make tests fail."

3,1,We ran Shaker on RxJava project and found the following likely flaky tests:
4,,
5,0,* synchronizationOfMultipleSequencesLoop -  failed 1 time in 12 reruns.
6,0,* blockingSourceAsnycCancel - failed 1 time in 12 reruns.

8,1,We sincerely hope that this can be useful information and look forward to hearing back.
