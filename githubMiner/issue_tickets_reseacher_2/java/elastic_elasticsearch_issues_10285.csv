0,1,ElasticSearch results using JAVA
1,1,"HI all, "
2,1,I am trying to use ElasticSearch within the JAVA API. As a JSON File (named Google.json) I am using the following structure:
3,0,{
4,0," ""markers"": ["
5,0,     {
6,0,"              ""point"":""new GLatLng(40.266044,-74.718479)"", "
7,0,"      ""homeTeam"":""Lawrence Library"","
8,0,"              ""awayTeam"":""LUGip"","
9,0,"              ""markerImage"":""images/red.png"","
10,0,"              ""information"": ""Linux users group meets second Wednesday of each month."","
11,0,"              ""fixture"":""Wednesday 7pm"","
12,0,"              ""capacity"":"""","
13,0,"             },"
14,0,             {
15,0,"              ""point"":""new GLatLng(40.266044,-74.75022)"", "
16,0,"      ""homeTeam"":""Hamilton Library"","
17,0,"              ""awayTeam"":""LUGip HW SIG"","
18,0,"              ""markerImage"":""images/white.png"","
19,0,"              ""information"": ""Linux users group meets second Tuesday of each month."","
20,0,"              ""fixture"":""Tuesday 7pm"","
21,0,"              ""capacity"":"""","
22,0,             }
23,0,           ]
24,0, }

26,1,"Using Jackson I am converting this file into a JAVA Hashmap. Then I try to search in field ""fixture"" for the Word ""Tuesday"". I am finding this, but as a result I am getting the complete ""markers"" List back instead of only the second element. I am now wondering what the problem is with my approach."
27,,
28,1,Here is my JAVA code:
29,,
30,0,JSONParser parser= new JSONParser();
31,0,"String path=""d:\Google.json"";"
32,,
33,0,Node node = nodeBuilder().local(true).node();
34,0,Client client = node.client();
35,,
36,0,/\* Jackson mapper*/
37,0,ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
38,0,File jsonFile=new File(path);
39,,
40,0,try {
41,0,            /_Read in file using Jackson into HashMap_/
42,0,"            Map<String, Object> mapObject=new HashMap<String, Object>();"
43,0,"            mapObject = mapper.readValue(jsonFile, new TypeReference<Map<String, Object>>(){});"
44,,
45,0,```
46,0,        /*Create index*/
47,0,        IndexResponse response=null;
48,0,"        response = client.prepareIndex(index, type)"
49,0,                .setSource(mapObject)
50,0,                .execute()
51,0,                .actionGet();
52,,
53,,
54,0,        } catch (JsonParseException e1) {
55,0,     e1.printStackTrace();
56,0,} catch (JsonMappingException e1) {
57,0,    e1.printStackTrace();
58,0,} catch (IOException e1) {
59,0,    e1.printStackTrace();
60,0,}
61,,
62,0,"    QueryBuilder qb=QueryBuilders.matchQuery(""fixture"",""Tuesday"");"
63,,
64,0,    SearchResponse response= client.prepareSearch(index)
65,0,            .setTypes(type)
66,0,            .setSearchType(SearchType.QUERY_AND_FETCH)
67,0,            .setQuery(qb)
68,0,            .setFrom(0)
69,0,            .setSize(100)
70,0,            .setExplain(true)
71,0,            .execute().actionGet();
72,,
73,0,    SearchHit[] results = response.getHits().getHits();
74,,
75,0,"    System.out.println(""Current results: "" + results.length);"
76,,
77,0,    for (SearchHit hit : results) {
78,0,"        System.out.println(""------------------------------"");"
79,0,"        Map<String,Object> result = hit.getSource();   "
80,0,        System.out.println(result);
81,0,    }
82,0,```
83,,
84,1,It would be great to get any hint/help on this!
85,,
86,1,"Cheers,"
87,1,Andi
