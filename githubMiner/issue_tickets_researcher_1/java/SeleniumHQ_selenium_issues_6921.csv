0,1,[Firefox] Selenium::WebDriver::Error::WebDriverError when trying to have an HTTP and HTTPS proxy
1,1,## üêõ Bug Report
2,,
3,1,I'm trying to have an HTTP and HTTPS proxy when running selenium with capybara. I looked at the various gist/SO answers and the documentation but I'm getting`Selenium::WebDriver::Error::WebDriverError` on the most probably to work code I have.
4,,
5,1,## To Reproduce
6,,
7,0,```
8,0,require 'selenium-webdriver'
9,0,require 'capybara/dsl'
10,,
11,0,Capybara.register_driver :selenium do |app|
12,0,  profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.new
13,0,"  proxy = Selenium::WebDriver::Proxy.new(http: ""localhost:8080"", ssl: ""localhost:8080"")"
14,0,  profile.proxy = proxy
15,0,  options = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Options.new(profile: profile)
16,0,"  Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, browser: :firefox, options: options)"
17,0,end
18,,
19,0,Capybara.current_driver = :selenium
20,0,```
21,,
22,1,## Expected behavior
23,,
24,1,Firefox should open and the HTTP and HTTPS requests should go through the proxy.
