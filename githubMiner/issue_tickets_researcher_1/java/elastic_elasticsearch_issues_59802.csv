13,1,**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:
14,,
15,1,"If a data stream contains multiple backing indices, the data streams stats API returns an error. The API works normally for data streams containing a single backing index."
16,,
17,1,**Steps to reproduce**:
18,,
19,1, 1. Create a data stream index template.
20,,
21,0,```
22,0,PUT /_index_template/template
23,0,{
24,0,"  ""index_patterns"": [""my-data-stream*""],"
25,0,"  ""data_stream"": { }"
26,0,}
27,0,```
28,,
29,1, 2. Create a matching data stream.
30,,
31,0,```
32,0,PUT /_data_stream/my-data-stream
33,0,```
34,,
35,1, 3. Roll over the data stream.
36,,
37,0,```
38,0,POST /my-data-stream/_rollover/
39,0,```
40,,
41,1,4. Retrieve stats for the data stream.
42,,
43,0,```
44,0,GET /_data_stream/my-data-stream/_stats
45,0,```
46,,
47,1,The API returns the following error:
48,,
49,0,```
50,0,{
51,0,"  ""error"" : {"
52,0,"    ""root_cause"" : ["
53,0,      {
54,0,"        ""type"" : ""illegal_argument_exception"","
