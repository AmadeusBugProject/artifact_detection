24,1,"In hits when using dynamic fields and sorting by one of them, the sort property contains ""Infinity"" or ""-Infinity"" which doesn't work properly with `search_after` for pagination."

35,1,**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:
36,,
37,1,"Sorting against a field that is a dynamic mapping and not populated for all results returns a sort per hit that could contain ""Infinity"" or ""-Infinity"".  This is problematic when attempting to get the next page."

47,1,"(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for"
48,1,"us to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it."
49,,
50,1, 1. Create an index with a dynamic field mapping
51,1, 2. Add some documents that contain a dynamic field and some that do not
52,1, 3. Issue a match all query and sort by the dynamic field that was created in step 2 and the UID.
53,1," 4. In the last hits, you will see that the `sort` property contains ""Infinity"" in the first position"
54,1, 5. Use that `sort` value as the `search_after` value to fetch the next page of results
