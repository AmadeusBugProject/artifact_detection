0,1,Merge @UiThread and @UiThreadDelayed?
1,1,"I think maybe we should merge `@UiThread` and `@UiThreadDelayed`, by adding a `value()` paramater to the `@UiThread` annotation that would be the delay :"
2,,
3,0,``` java
4,0,@UiThread(3000)
5,0,void delayed() {
6,,
7,0,}
8,,
9,0,@UiThread // Equivalent to @UiThread(0)
10,0,void onUiThread() {
11,,
12,0,}
13,0,```
