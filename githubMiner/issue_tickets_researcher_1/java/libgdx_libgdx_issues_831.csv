0,1,Recent snapshots stopped working on Scala
1,1,After update to recent snapshot I'm unable to compile my code that is written in Scala. The error says:

10,1,This looks similar to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?format=multiple&id=398657 but I'm not sure if this is it or not.

12,1,"I can guarantee that earlier version of nightlies of gdx.jar works (sorry, don't have date - should have copied them before updating, but I have few apps built with it, last build yesterday using same code as today...) - I looked for other versions I have and version from 23'rd September seems to have same behaviour. I'm pretty sure, that version that worked was around 4'th-14'th September - this is when I remember I had to sync with nightlies. Some in between could work as well, but i'm not sure."

14,1,Would be wonderful if someone could look into it before final 0.9.9 release. I'd be happy to provide any extra information you might need.
