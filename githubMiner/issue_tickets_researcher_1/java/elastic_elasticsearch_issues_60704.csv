0,1,"create data stream REST API spec indicates body is supported, but does not on 8.0.0-SNAPSHOT"

2,,
3,1,The `indices.create_data_stream.json` REST API spec indicates that a body is supported:
4,,
5,0,https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/393ce41740007d4ed0341d2116b8c739974d0f6c/x-pack/plugin/src/test/resources/rest-api-spec/api/indices.create_data_stream.json#L26-L28

7,1,"However, Elasticsearch returns an error to indicate that the API does not support having a body on 8.0.0-SNAPSHOT."
8,,
9,1,### Steps to reproduce
10,,
11,1,1. Spin up a default distribution 8.0.0-SNAPSHOT Elasticsearch instance
12,1,2. Create a composable index template
13,,
14,0,```sh
15,0,"curl -X PUT ""https://localhost:9200/_index_template/logs_data_stream?pretty"" -u elastic:changeme \"
16,0,-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -k -d'
17,0,{
18,0,"  ""index_patterns"": [ ""logs*"" ],"
19,0,"  ""data_stream"": { },"
20,0,"  ""template"": {"
21,0,"    ""settings"": {"
22,0,"      ""index.lifecycle.name"": ""logs_policy"""
23,0,    }
24,0,  }
25,0,}
26,0,```
27,,
28,1,3. Create a data stream with an empty object body
29,,
30,0,```sh
31,0,"curl -X PUT ""https://localhost:9200/_data_stream/logs_alt?pretty"" -k -u elastic:changeme \"
32,0,-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
33,0,```
34,,
35,1,4. Observe the following error is returned
36,,
37,0,```json
38,0,{
39,0,"  ""error"" : {"
40,0,"    ""root_cause"" : ["
41,0,      {
42,0,"        ""type"" : ""illegal_argument_exception"","
43,0,"        ""reason"" : ""request [PUT /_data_stream/logs_alt] does not support having a body"""
44,0,      }
45,0,"    ],"
46,0,"    ""type"" : ""illegal_argument_exception"","
47,0,"    ""reason"" : ""request [PUT /_data_stream/logs_alt] does not support having a body"""
48,0,"  },"
49,0,"  ""status"" : 400"
50,0,}
51,0,```
52,,
53,1,### Possible solution
54,,
55,1,Remove the `body` property from the `indices.create_data_stream.json` REST API spec.
56,,
57,1,"Official language clients use this property to determine whether the generated implementation should expose a way to set a request body for an API, or, if the client models an API request with a type, whether the type should be serialized to the request stream."
58,,
59,1,Note that 7.9.0-SNAPSHOT does not return an error when sent `{}` in the request body.
