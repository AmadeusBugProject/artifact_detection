0,1,Configuration of property followDirect for rest client
1,1,**Description**
2,1,We are communicating with an external system via rest client. For some endpoints the system uses the redirect-feature (Responsecode 301) to forward the request to another endpoint. But this feature is disabled for the resteasy client and currently there is no option the change this via a property.

13,1,Update:

15,1,It's exactly the other way around: By default the redirect-feature is enabled for the resteasy client and I want to be able to disable this feature ;-)
