11,1,#### Describe the problem you're observing:
12,1,"This has been an issue for a long time, but I just thought it was because I was running herbstluftwm and not a full DE, but recently I had a need to use dbeaver on a system with KDE and a Windows 10 system and both also did the same thing.  Since I've tested this on several Arch and Ubuntu systems running, i3, KDE and herbstluftwm, as well as several different Windows 10 machines.  I've also tested both MariaDB and MySQl servers and no matter the combination, they all do the same thing.  When in the table editor and I click on a enum field to edit, it used to give a drop down list of the possible enum values.  Now it displays the down arrow, but it never shows the values.  If you use the scroll wheel on the mouse or two finger scrolling on a touch pad it will scroll through the values, but the menu won't display."
