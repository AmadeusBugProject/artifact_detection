0,1,dl4j beta4 F1 score 0 Vs beta3 F1 score 0.99
1,1," I trained a CNN model that learnt to do predictions with 99% Accuracy, F1Score, precision and recall. That was with dl4j 1.0.0-beta3"
2,,
3,1,"Moving to beta4, the model Accuracy is ok but the F1 Score, precision and recall are all zero or nan."
4,,
5,1,For sure there is something wrong but I can't find out what is it.
6,1,#### Version Information
7,,
8,1,"Please indicate relevant versions, including, if relevant:"
9,,
10,1,* Deeplearning4j version: 1.0.0-beta4
11,1,"* Platform information (OS, etc): Ubuntu 16.04"
12,1,"* CUDA version, if used : 9.2"
13,1,"* NVIDIA driver version, if in use: Latest"
14,1,* docker version: 19.03.1
15,1,*Nvidia docker: version 2
16,1,I use docker swarm to manage the cluster. Swarm manager will run spark master and swarm nodes will be the workers.
17,,
18,1,To start the swarm manager
19,0,`sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr <sparkMasterHostName>`
20,,
21,1,"This will output a token, to be used by workers to joint the swarm"
22,0,`sudo docker swarm join --token <token> <sparkMasterHostName>:2377`
23,,
24,1,I created two branches. One branch runs beta3 and the other runs beta4. The issue can't be reproduced using a parallelwrapper. It must run on a cluster to reproduce.
25,,
26,1,"I used a cluster on Azure, a master with two slaves, all running docker engine. All  images used are available publicly and the dataset resides in Azure open container, no password or key required. Each machine has 4 GPUS (Nvidia p40)"
27,,
28,1,"To run it, all you have to do is run docker stack deploy from the root folder:"
29,0,`docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml dl4j_min_example`
30,,
31,1,"The output will be in the logs of the spark-submit container in the master node, to view it, just use  `Docker logs -f <spark-submit-container-id>`"
32,,
33,1,Attached are the links to the two branches as well as gist files for the output of the two runs.
