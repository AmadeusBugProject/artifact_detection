0,1,Hikari CP maxLifetime / idleTimeout
1,1,Hikari CP Version : 2.7.4
2,,
3,1,This is actually not an issue but some doubts.
4,1,a) maxLifetime : retires the connection after 30 mins. Will it also create a new connection automatically at the time of killing it or it waits for a new request and then creates a new connectios? considering pool has more than minIdle.
5,,
6,1,b) idleTimeout : it will drop after 10 mins of inactivity? but 10mins is too high. is it ok if i mark it as 10s(10 is min as seen from code) as otherwise there will always be connections higher than min-connections?
