0,1,[5.7] Model::firstOrCreate Integrity constraint violation
1,1,- Laravel Version: 5.7.26
2,1,- PHP Version: 7.1.15
3,1,- Database Driver & Version: **sqlite 3.11**
4,,
5,1,### Description:
6,1,"When using an sqlite database, `Model::firstOrCreate` can't find an existing model and tries to create another one. This happens when it searches for a date attribute that is in the `$casts` array."
7,,
8,1,"The example code below fails when using an Sqlite database, but works correctly using a Mysql database."
9,,
10,1,### Steps To Reproduce:
11,1,Migration:
12,0,```php
13,0,"Schema::create('example_models', function (Blueprint $table) {"
14,0,    $table->increments('id');
15,0,    $table->date('date')->unique();
16,0,    $table->timestamps();
17,0,});
18,0,```
19,,
20,1,Model:
21,0,```php
22,0,class ExampleModel extends Model
23,0,{
24,0,    protected $guarded = [];
25,,
26,0,    protected $casts = [
27,0,        // if you comment out the cast it works correctly
28,0,"        'date' => 'date',"
29,0,    ];
30,0,}
31,0,```
32,,
33,1,then call the method twice:
34,0,```php
35,0,ExampleModel::firstOrCreate(['date' => now()->format('Y-m-d')]);
36,,
37,0,ExampleModel::firstOrCreate(['date' => now()->format('Y-m-d')]);
38,0,```
39,,
40,0,"Will throw a `SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 19 UNIQUE constraint failed` exception, because the second `firstOrCreate` somehow can't find the model and tries to create another one."
41,,
