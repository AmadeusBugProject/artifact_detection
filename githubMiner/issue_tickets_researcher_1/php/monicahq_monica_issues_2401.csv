0,1,Adding conversation with no messages shows error but succeeds
1,1,"When logging a conversation without adding any messages, the page displays an error when attempting to save, but it actually successfully saves. (I don't add messages to conversations because I only want to log that I talked to that person that day, so I can make sure I am interacting with everyone I need to regularly)"
