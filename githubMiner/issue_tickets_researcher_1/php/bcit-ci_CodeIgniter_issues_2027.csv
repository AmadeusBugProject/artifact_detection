0,1,add_key() in DB Forge is not behaving correctly
1,1,"So it looks like this issue was submitted here : https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/issues/1946, but has since been closed. Following the thread comment, I didn't see any resolution to the problem at all."
2,,
3,1,this code should create a key called blog_name_blog_label
4,,
5,0,``` php
6,0,"$this->dbforge->add_key(array('blog_name', 'blog_label'));"
7,0,```
8,,
9,1,"unfortunately, it just throws a warning"
10,,
11,0,```
12,0,Severity: Warning
13,,
14,0,Message: Illegal offset type in isset or empty
15,,
16,0,Filename: mysqli/mysqli_forge.php
17,,
18,0,Line Number: 184
19,0,```
20,,
21,1,"Looking through the code, I noticed that the mysqli_forge.php file on line 184 doesn't handle keys that are arrays, thus the problem shown above."
22,,
23,0,``` php
24,0,// these keys can be arrays
25,0,if ( ! isset($this->fields[$this->keys[$i]]))
26,0,{
27,0,  unset($this->keys[$i]);
28,0,  continue;
29,0,}
30,0,```
31,,
32,1,the fix is simple enough
33,,
34,0,``` php
35,0,if(is_array($this->keys[$i]))
36,0,{
37,0,  foreach($this->keys[$i] as $key)
38,0,  {
39,0,    if( ! isset($this->fields[$key]))
40,0,    {
41,0,      unset($this->keys[$i]);
42,0,      break;
43,0,    }
44,0,  }
45,0,}
46,0,else
47,0,{
48,0,  if ( ! isset($this->fields[$this->keys[$i]]))
49,0,  {
50,0,    unset($this->keys[$i]);
51,0,    continue;
52,0,  }
53,0,}
54,0,```
55,,
56,1,However I'm not sure about just 'unsetting' the values. Would it make more sense to throw an error here instead?
