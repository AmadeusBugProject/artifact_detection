0,1,Simple CSV Export
1,1,Is there a way to create a simple CSV export without creating a sheet?  I tried something like the below and couldn't figure out how to make it work...
2,,
3,0,```
4,0,        /** @var \Maatwebsite\Excel\Excel $excel */
5,0,        $excel = App::make('excel');
6,0,        $storageData = $excel
7,0,            ->create('dailyReport')
8,0,            ->with($csvData)
9,0,"            ->store('csv', $storagePath, true);"
10,0,```

12,1,It seems I have to create a sheet in order to get the document to generate successfully.
