0,1,Feature request Menu widget - hideInActiveNephews
1,1,"Most of the times when using a menu with subitems, it is not necessary to also output the subitems of other menu items which are inactive (the nephews). "
2,1,Usecase:
3,1,1) performance: prevents HTML being outputted (large menus)
4,1,2) flexibility: when only 1 vertical menu 'echelon line' is required (for whatever reason)
5,,
6,1,Currently:
7,1,- outputted in HTML & active: menu 1
8,1,- outputted in HTML & active: menu 1 > menu 1.1
9,1,- outputted in HTML & non-active: menu 2
10,1,- outputted in HTML & non-active: menu 2 > menu 2.1
11,,
12,1,Therefore I would suggest to add another parameter called:
13,1,- hideInactiveNephews
14,1,- or hideNephews
15,,
16,1,This will prevent the output of redundant and non visible menu items which would never be visible in the current route:
17,1,- outputted in HTML & active: menu 1
18,1,- outputted in HTML  & active: menu 1 > menu 1.1
19,1,- outputted in HTML & non-active: menu 2
20,1,- not outputted in HTML & non-active: menu 2 > menu 2.1
