15,1,### Steps to reproduce
16,1,1. New install of NextCloud
17,1,"2. Klick on the ""Banner"" with warnings"
18,1,3. Klick to the list of security warnings
19,1,"4. Read warning concerning HSTS: The ""Strict-Transport-Security"" HTTP header is not set to at least ""15552000"" seconds. For enhanced security, it is recommended to enable HSTS as described in the security tips."""
20,1,"5. Klick link ""security tips"""
21,1,6. Try to find the related topic (It's the last one in the list.)
22,1,"6. Browser search funktion for ""HSTS"""
23,1,7. read article
24,1,"8. Copy, that you're out of the game if you don't have access to Apache config files. At least what the next cloud documentation tells you."
25,1,9. Google for .htaccess and HSTS.
26,,
27,1,### Expected behaviour
28,1,For those who like to install NextCloud on other ressources than a root-server it would be nice to know that it wouldn't be necessary to get into the main config files of apache to improve the security. Googling brings a solution for .htaccess:
29,1,"Header always add Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=15768000; includeSubDomains; preload"""
30,,
31,1,### Actual behaviour
32,1,"A warning and an article documentation which, in parts, is not helpful for a group of users."
