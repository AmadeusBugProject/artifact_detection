1,1,**Guzzle version(s) affected**: 6.3-dev
2,1,**PHP version**: 7.3.14
3,1,**cURL version**: 7.66.0
4,,
5,1,**Description**
6,1,"Getting **Uncaught Exception: Invalid resource type: resource (closed)** when trying to save the response of a request directly to a file, one of the issues is that it only happens some times, this code works fine for most of the time."
7,,
8,1,The resource(closed)  should be the gettype only after fclose() so I am not sure what is going on.
9,,
10,1,**How to reproduce**
11,0,```
12,0,        $client = new Client();
13,0,"        $fn      = tempnam(sys_get_temp_dir(), 'some-prefix-');"
14,0,"        $fp      = fopen($fn, 'r+');"
15,0,"        $res = $client->request('GET', $url, ['sink' => $fp]);"
16,0,        $stream = $res->getBody()->detach();
17,0,        $stat   = fstat($stream);
18,0,        fclose($fp);
19,0,```
20,,
21,1,**Possible Solution**
22,1,Maybe it is related to something asycronous happening?
23,,
24,1,**Additional context**
25,1,This is a code I have to upload files directly from a URL
