11,1,## About
12,1,@xabbuh @Tobion I am not sure if i understand the issue right but i stumpled over this post when i searched for existing tickets for my issue - which sounds quite similar.
13,,
14,1,"If context::$host is empty, fx if you generate url from a command, then the $hostTokens are not replaced because this foreach loop is nested inside a condition which checks if host is set."
15,,
16,1,This means that although you have set default host for this route its not going to be replaced because host is empty.

51,1,If you set a host (no matter what) the relevant code will be reached and thus the default value for host used.
