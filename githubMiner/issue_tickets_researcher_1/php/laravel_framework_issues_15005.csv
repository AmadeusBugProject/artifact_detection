20,1,"The $user parameter on this method expects (though is not type-hinted to be) an implementation of **\Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\CanResetPassword** but the method body treats it like an Eloquent model with calls to _$user->forceFill()_, _$user->save()_, etc."
21,,
22,1,Perhaps the **Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\CanResetPassword** contract and the default implementation should be updated to include a 'resetPassword()' method? Something would also need to be done about the call to _$this->guard()->login($user)_.
