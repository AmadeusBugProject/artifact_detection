0,1, Service Descriptions : Aggregator
1,1,"Hello,"
2,,
3,1,It would be nice if we were able to use custom aggregator in service descriptions.
4,1,Actually when defining a parameter like that :
5,,
6,0,```
7,0,'parameters' => array(
8,0,    'foo' => array(
9,0,"        'type' => 'array',"
10,0,        'location' => 'query'
11,0,    )
12,0,)
13,0,```
14,,
15,1,the result is
16,,
17,0,```
18,0,foo[0]=baz&foo[1]=bar
19,0,```
20,,
21,1,but me I would like to change it to render like that
22,,
23,0,```
24,0,foo0=baz&foo1=bar
25,0,```
26,,
27,1,"Thanks in advance,"
