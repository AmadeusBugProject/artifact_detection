0,1,Kindly Ask plugins developers of plugins for Piwik 1.x to convert to Piwik 2 platform
1,1,"As of [Piwik 2.0](http://piwik.org/blog/2013/12/piwik-2-0-release-announced-biggest-best-release-yet/), Piwik has been rewritten to use the latest technologies (PHP 5.3, namespaces, twig, etc.). All plugins available for Piwik 1.x have to be rewritten. Often the changes are minor, but still takes any developer at least a few hours to convert it."
