0,1,Add ability to manually setup dataproviders
1,1,"Hi,"
2,,
3,1,This is a feature request to allow users to set which data-providers are used by tests through code rather than using annotations.
4,,
5,1,I prefer to run my unit-tests in an environment that matches as closely as possible the environment that the code will be run in production. However as I don't use annotations in my code I use the php.ini option:
6,,
7,0,```
8,0,opcache.save_comments=0
9,0,```
10,,
11,1,"which is a small optimization for not loading comments. However this means that all annotations fail, as the comments just aren't available to PHPunit."
12,,
13,1,"It seems wrong having to either not use data-providers, or having to test in an environment that doesn't match production."
14,,
15,1,"I guess the syntax for coding which data providers are used, would be something like this:"
16,,
17,0,```
18,0,"self::setDataProvider('dataProviderFunctionName', 'testName');"
19,0,```
20,,
21,1,in the `setUpBeforeClass` function for the test.
22,,
23,1,cheers
