32,1,When I run this command:
33,,
34,0,```
35,0,composer remove swiftmailer/swiftmailer; echo $?
36,0,```
37,,
38,1,I get the following output:
39,,
40,0,```
41,0,swiftmailer/swiftmailer is not required in your composer.json and has not been removed
42,0,Loading composer repositories with package information
43,0,Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
44,0,Nothing to install or update
45,0,Generating autoload files
46,0,```
47,,
48,1,And I expected this to happen:
49,,
50,1,"1. A message telling me that swiftmailer was not removed (maybe with a reason: 'hard requirement by laravel/framework"")"
51,1,"2. Exit code of non-0, because 0 means success."
52,,
53,1,"I want to *remove* a package, and composer did not do that - and failed to tell me that. The package I wanted to remove is still installed."
54,,
55,1,"I do know that ""composer remove"" currently only removes the entry from `composer.json` and then runs ""update"", but thats implementation detail. The user's intent when using ""remove"" is that a package shall be removed, and composer doesn't behave in a way the user would expect."
