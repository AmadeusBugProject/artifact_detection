9,1,I was reviewing this article about service factories https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/factories.html and found this example:
10,,
11,0,```yaml
12,0,# config/services.yaml
13,0,App\Email\NewsletterManager:
14,0,    # new syntax
15,0,    factory: 'App\Email\NewsletterManagerFactory:createNewsletterManager'
16,0,```
17,,
18,1,We recently made some changes (https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-4-1-deprecated-the-bundle-notation) to always allow using `::` to separate the class and the method name instead of using `:` sometimes and `::` others.

20,1,"@Tobion can you remember if your recent PR also took care of this service factory case? If not, do you think you could work on this before the 4.1 feature freeze (which starts in 23 days)? Thanks!"
