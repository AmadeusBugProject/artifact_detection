0,1,[5.1] Is Auth::logout() working as intended?
1,1,"Hello,"
2,1,"I am using Laravel 5.1. I recently started to extend the Auth Guard. I am wondering if the logout functionality is as intended in regards to ""remember_token""."
3,,
4,1,Here is current code:
5,,
6,0,```
7,0,        $user = $this->user();
8,,
9,0,        $this->clearUserDataFromStorage();
10,,
11,0,        if (! is_null($this->user)) {
12,0,            $this->refreshRememberToken($user);
13,0,        }
14,,
15,0,        if (isset($this->events)) {
16,0,"            $this->events->fire('auth.logout', [$user]);"
17,0,        }
18,,
19,0,        $this->user = null;
20,,
21,0,        $this->loggedOut = true;
22,0,```
23,,
24,1,The part I am curious on is the first check if (! is_null($this->user). Unless I am missing something this will always attempt to refresh the RememberToken even if the model does not have remember me capability.
25,,
26,1,Here is the slight adjustment I made to make that check
27,,
28,0,```
29,0,"        if (! is_null($this->user) && array_key_exists('remember_token', $this->user->getAttributes()))"
30,0,        {
31,0,            $this->refreshRememberToken($user);
32,0,        }
33,0,```
34,,
35,1,I could just be missing something.
