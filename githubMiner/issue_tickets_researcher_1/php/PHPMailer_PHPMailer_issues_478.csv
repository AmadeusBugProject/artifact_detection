0,1,Error sending mail with inline images with no file name
1,1,"Hi,"
2,1,"Wanted to let you know that when sending mail through amazon mail server (this didnt happen with gmail) with inline images that were added through **addStringEmbeddedImage** or extracted from the html with **msgHTML** (which uses addStringEmbeddedImage), we received the error: _Transaction failed: Expected parameter value, got ""null""_."
3,,
4,1,We found this happens when using _addStringEmbeddedImage_ with no file name for the third argument.
5,1,Because of this 2 of the mime values
6,1,"**'Content-Type: %s; name=""%s""%s'** and "
7,1,"**'Content-Disposition: %s; filename=""%s""%s'** in the function _attachAll_ were empty and this caused the error with amazon mail server."
8,1,when supplied with file name in those mime values the mail was sent with no error.
9,,
10,1,Maybe there should be some default file name in those cases.

12,1,Great library by the way!
