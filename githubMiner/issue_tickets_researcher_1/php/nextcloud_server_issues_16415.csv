0,1,Changes of multi user edits on a single file don't show in activities
1,1,"Hey guys,"
2,,
3,1,"we have a problem tracking the changes of files in Nextcloud when a couple of users collaborate on the same file(s). To test this behaviour we created a new text file and made a couple of changes on it alternating between users. However, under activities each user only gets his own last changes listed."
4,1,What we expect is to see all the changes of all the users. Can this be achieved? Or is there some kind of plugin for this?
5,,
6,1,### Steps to reproduce
7,1,"1. Create a new file in Nextcloud, make some changes to it, save and close it"
8,1,"2. Another user opens the same file, makes some additional changes, saves and closes it"
9,1,3. These steps can be done repeatedly
10,1,"4. Each user only get his own changes listed, all the changes to the file cannot be tracked"
11,,
12,1,### Expected behaviour
13,1,All users should be able to see all the changes to the files they edited
14,,
15,1,### Actual behaviour
16,1,Only my own last changes are listed to me
