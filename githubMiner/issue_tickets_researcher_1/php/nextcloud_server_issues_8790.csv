15,1,### Steps to reproduce
16,1,1. Open web interface
17,1,2. Create a new text file
18,1,2. Copy that file to your home directory
19,1,3. Open file the file in it's destination
20,,
21,1,### Expected behaviour
22,1,Tell us what should happen
23,,
24,1,I would have expected the file to have been copied properly and be accessible at it's new location.
25,,
26,1,### Actual behaviour
27,1,Tell us what happens instead
28,,
29,1,When opening the file from the new location this error message pops up:
30,,
31,0,"<img width=""222"" alt=""screen shot 2018-03-12 at 08 30 09"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1026337/37298780-b61b211a-25f7-11e8-815c-70833698b7b2.png"">"
32,,
33,1,When the next sync run happens this error pops up.
34,0,"<img width=""330"" alt=""screen shot 2018-03-12 at 08 33 57"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1026337/37283972-4259102e-25d0-11e8-8203-8becdd1fe7b9.png"">"
35,,
36,1,And these errors exist in the logs:
37,,
38,0,fopen(https://s3-gm-storage.powerhrg.com/nextcloud-default/urn%3Aoid%3A2971593): failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found
39,0, at /var/www/nextcloud/lib/private/Files/ObjectStore/S3ObjectTrait.php#66
40,,
41,1,The file is created in the NextCloud default directory which is also on S3 but it's not the file NextCloud thinks it is.
42,1,I found this file with the contents of the file I moved: urn/oid/2971658
43,,
44,1,So NextCloud seems to be getting confused somewhere and not using the right file in the S3 bucket.
