0,1,"""printerFile"" relative paths behavior causing some problems"
1,1,"Hi,"
2,,
3,1,"it seems that using ""printerFile"" relative paths in phpunit.xml leads to some problems / restricts how tests can be executed."
4,,
5,1,This is part of the phpunit.xml we generate for the root of the project:
6,,
7,0,```
8,0,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>"
9,0,<phpunit
10,0,"    xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"""
11,0,"    xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""lib/phpunit/phpunit.xsd"""
12,0,"    bootstrap=""lib/phpunit/bootstrap.php"""
13,0,    ....
14,0,    ....
15,0,"    printerClass=""Hint_ResultPrinter"""
16,0,"    printerFile=""lib/phpunit/classes/hint_resultprinter.php"""
17,0,    >
18,0,<testsuites>
19,0, ....
20,0, ....
21,0,```
22,,
23,1,"And, this one example for the phpunit corresponding to one plugin/module (/mod/forum, 2 dirs deeper):"
24,,
25,0,```
26,0,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>"
27,0,<phpunit
28,0,"    xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"""
29,0,"    xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""../../lib/phpunit/phpunit.xsd"""
30,0,"    bootstrap=""../../lib/phpunit/bootstrap.php"""
31,0,    ....
32,0,    ....
33,0,"    printerClass=""Hint_ResultPrinter"""
34,0,"    printerFile=""../../lib/phpunit/classes/hint_resultprinter.php"""
35,0,    >
36,0,<testsuites>
37,0, ....
38,0, ....
39,0,```
40,,
41,1,Using those phpunit files we are able to run:
42,,
43,0,```
44,0,cd /path/to/rootdir && phpunit
45,0,cd /path/to/rootdir/mod/forum && phpunit
46,0,```
47,,
48,1,"But any of these fail with error: ""Could not use ""Hint_ResultPrinter"" as printer."""
49,,
50,0,```
51,0,cd /path/to/rootdir && cd .. && phpunit -c rootdir
52,0,cd /path/to/rootdir && cd .. && phpunit -c rootdir/phpunit.xml
53,0,cd /path/to/rootdir && phpunit -c mod/forum
54,0,cd /path/to/rootdir && phpunit -c mod/forum/phpunit.xml
55,0,```
56,,
57,1,"And they were working ok before introducing the custom ResultPrinter in phpunit.xml. Also note that we use the relative path for the bootstrap and is working perfectly, so it would be desirable to get also the printerFile supporting those relatives."
58,,
59,1,For reference:
60,1,- code-base: https://github.com/moodle/moodle
61,1,- original issue in Moodle tracker (fixed by temp removal of the printerFile from the generated phpunit.xml files: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-33436

63,1,Ciao :-)
