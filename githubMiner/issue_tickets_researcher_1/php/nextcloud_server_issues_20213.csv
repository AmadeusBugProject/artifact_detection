0,1,Implement occ system:cron like in owncloud
1,1,I was just making some tests with the previewgenerator app and I wanted to understand better how the whole system works. I was stumbling over the table oc_jobs and I wanted to start/debug the cron job that will (as far as I know) execute exactly these jobs in this table.
2,1,"In the end I found an occ command to execute the cron jobs with an option ""-p"" to get a progress information. But this command is not implemented in nextcloud so I had a look into the code of owncloud et voila: "

5,1,"Does it make sense to also implement this in nextcloud? I have seen, that this file is quite new in owncloud as well (implemented on Jul 4, 2019)."
