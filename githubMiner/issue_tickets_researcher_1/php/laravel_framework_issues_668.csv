0,1,Eloquent lists() should use model accessor mutators
1,1,It seems that lists() does not use the accessor mutators when setting values into the $values array. I've got the following:
2,,
3,0,``` php
4,0,// in model
5,0,public function getValueAttribute($value)
6,0,{
7,0,    // change the value
8,0,}
9,,
10,0,// in controller
11,0,"$details = MyModel::lists('value', 'setting');"
12,0,```
13,,
14,1,"$details has the actual value from the database, and not the mutated one."
