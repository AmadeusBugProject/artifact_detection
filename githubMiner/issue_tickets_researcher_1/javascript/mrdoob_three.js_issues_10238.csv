0,1,EffectComposer - low resolution in retina screens
1,1,##### Description of the problem
2,,
3,1,"I'm using EffectComposer to add post processing shaders to a renderer, and although the shader works fine, in retina screens (like iOS) the resolution is low and edges are pixelatedâ€¦ The renderer's pixelRatio and size were set and everything seems ok."
4,,
5,1,All the shader post-processing examples available on https://threejs.org/examples/?q=postprocessing also have the same low-resolution. An example is https://threejs.org/examples/?q=postprocessing#webgl_postprocessing_nodes (the edges look blurry on iPhone).
6,,
7,1,Is that a WebKit bug or something that can be fixed on Three.js by setting the pixelRatio some other way?
