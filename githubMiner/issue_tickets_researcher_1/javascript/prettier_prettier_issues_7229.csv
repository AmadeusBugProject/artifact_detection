0,1,API: prettier.format reloads plugins on every call
1,1,**Description**
2,,
3,1,"Calling the `prettier.format` Node.js API causes plugins to be reloaded every time, even if the formatting options remain the same."
4,1,"This appears to slow down formatting, since plugin directories are (seemingly) accessed synchronously each time."
5,,
6,1,**Environments:**
7,1,- Prettier Version: `1.19.1`
8,1,- Running Prettier via: `Node.js API`
9,1,- Runtime: `Node.js v12.14.0`
100,1,- Operating System: `Windows`
11,,
12,1,**Steps to reproduce:**
13,,
14,1,Call `prettier.format` API multiple times as seen in the following example.
15,,
16,0,```js
17,0,// main.js
18,0,//
19,0,// Flamegraph command: clinic flame -- node main.js
20,,
21,0,const prettier = require('prettier');
22,,
23,0,// Options are fixed
24,0,const options = {
25,0,"    semi: true,"
26,0,"    singleQuote: true,"
27,0,"    trailingComma: 'es5',"
28,0,"    tabWidth: 4,"
29,0,"    printWidth: 60,"
30,0,"    endOfLine: 'lf',"
31,0,"    arrowParens: 'always',"
32,0,"    parser: 'typescript',"
33,0,};
34,,
35,0,// Three differently named functions to show different call stacks
36,0,function foo() {
37,0,"    prettier.format('', options);"
38,0,}
39,,
40,0,function bar() {
41,0,"    prettier.format('', options);"
42,0,}
43,,
44,0,function baz() {
45,0,"    prettier.format('', options);"
46,0,}
47,,
48,0,// Repeatedly calling `prettier.format` with the same options
49,0,// causes plugins to be constantly reloaded from directories
50,0,// as seen in the flamegraph below.
51,0,const max = 100;
52,0,for (let i = 0; i < max; i++) {
53,0,    foo();
54,0,    bar();
55,0,    baz();
56,0,}
57,0,```
58,,
59,1,**Expected behavior:**
60,,
61,1,It should be possible to load plugins (if necessary) only once for a given set of options and then use the returned formatter to format different input texts.
62,,
63,1,**Actual behavior:**
64,,
65,1,Plugins are reloaded from directories with each call to `prettier.format` as seen in [this flamegraph](https://upload.clinicjs.org/public/66c03b913bf6053ddb6dbffc4181266671f0e98adf6a45655731583d159067b7/16704.clinic-flame.html)
