10,1,### Description
11,,
12,1,Here is the excerpt of test-spec for my cursor-history pkg.
13,1,"Maybe because of bug of v1.25.0-beta3, `atom.config.get` return actual config defined in `config.cson` rather than it's default value in the very first executed section."
14,1,Which make `f`-ocused spec tested in wrong condition. Also very first test is executed in environment dependent config value.
15,,
16,1,"From quick code check(not tested throughly), maybe these lines does set env specific config."

18,1,May be because of change in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16628#issuecomment-367172653?

39,1,### Steps to Reproduce
40,,
41,1,1. write sample test spec I explained above using whatever config you want(e.g. `atom.config.get('editor.atomicSoftTabs')`).
42,1,2. See how `atom.config.get` return value change in 1st and 2nd section of test spec.
43,,
44,1,**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
45,,
46,1,Test spec should be executed in default configuration like in v1.24.0.
47,,
48,1,**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
49,,
50,1,Test spec is executed in env-dependent config for very first call of `atom.config.get`.
51,,
52,1,**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]
