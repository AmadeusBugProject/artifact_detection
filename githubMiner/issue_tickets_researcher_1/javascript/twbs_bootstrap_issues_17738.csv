0,1,Alpha Bootstrap 4 _carousel.scss missing webkit transition?
1,1,"Hi,"
2,1,I am using sass and I had issues with the slider on devices. The transitions were not working. So doing some research I came across this thread https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/14973 and found my answer. The _carousel.scss was missing a few rules around lines 24
3,,
4,1,Here is the original _carousel.scss:
5,,
6,0,```
7,0,   // WebKit CSS3 transforms for supported devices
8,0,"    @media all and (transform-3d), (-webkit-transform-3d) {"
9,0,      transition: transform .6s ease-in-out;
10,0,      backface-visibility: hidden;
11,0,      perspective: 1000px;
12,,
13,0,"      &.next,"
14,0,      &.active.right {
15,0,        left: 0;
16,0,"        transform: translate3d(100%, 0, 0);"
17,0,      }
18,0,"      &.prev,"
19,0,      &.active.left {
20,0,        left: 0;
21,0,"        transform: translate3d(-100%, 0, 0);"
22,0,      }
23,0,"      &.next.left,"
24,0,"      &.prev.right,"
25,0,      &.active {
26,0,        left: 0;
27,0,"        transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);"
28,0,      }
29,0,    }
30,0,```
31,,
32,1,Here's how I edited it and the slider is now working:
33,,
34,0,```
35,0,// WebKit CSS3 transforms for supported devices
36,0,"    @media all and (transform-3d), (-webkit-transform-3d) {"
37,,
38,0,      -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform .6s ease-in-out;
39,0,        -o-transition:      -o-transform .6s ease-in-out;
40,0,          transition: transform .6s ease-in-out;
41,,
42,0,      -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
43,0,          backface-visibility: hidden;
44,,
45,0,      -webkit-perspective: 1000px;
46,0,          perspective: 1000px;
47,,
48,0,"      &.next,"
49,0,      &.active.right {
50,0,        left: 0;
51,,
52,0,"        -webkit-transform: translate3d(100%, 0, 0);"
53,0,"          transform: translate3d(100%, 0, 0);"
54,0,      }
55,0,"      &.prev,"
56,0,      &.active.left {
57,0,        left: 0;
58,,
59,0,"        -webkit-transform: translate3d(-100%, 0, 0);"
60,0,"          transform: translate3d(-100%, 0, 0);"
61,0,      }
62,0,"      &.next.left,"
63,0,"      &.prev.right,"
64,0,      &.active {
65,0,        left: 0;
66,,
67,0,"        -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);"
68,0,"          transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);"
69,0,      }
70,0,    }
71,0,  }
72,0,```
73,,
74,1,Hope this can help others and that the Bootstrap 4 developers will include it soon...
