0,1,Customization Options docs could be clearer about variable overrides
1,1,The [customizing options doc](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/options/#customizing-variables) says:
2,1,"> Every Sass variable in Bootstrap 4 includes the !default flag, meaning you can override that default value in your own Sass **_even after that original variableâ€™s been defined_**. Copy and paste variables as needed, modify the values, remove the !default flag, and recompile."
3,,
4,1,I read this to mean that I can override variables in my Sass _after_ importing bootstrap.scss:
5,,
6,0,```
7,0,"@import ""../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss"";"
8,0,"@import ""my-overrides"""
9,0,```
10,,
11,0,_my-overrides.scss:
12,,
13,0,```
14,0,"$link-color: map-get($my-colors, link);"
15,0,```
16,,
17,1,Per the [Sass docs](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#Variable_Defaults___default) for `!default` variables:
18,,
19,1,"> ...if the variable has already been assigned to, it won't be re-assigned, but if it doesn't have a value yet, it will be given one."
20,,
21,1,"So really, I have to do overrides _before_ Boostrap imports _variables.scss:"
22,,
23,0,```
24,0,"@import ""my-overrides"""
25,0,"@import ""../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss"";"
26,0,```
27,,
28,1,I think the docs could be a little clearer in this regard.
