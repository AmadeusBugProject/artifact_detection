0,1,"suggestions for non-www to www rewrite (enabled on domain, disabled on subdomains)"
1,1,Hi.
2,1,This may be just a matter of taste.
3,1,I suggest  changing this:
4,,
5,0,```
6,0,<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
7,0,RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
8,0,RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\..+$ [NC]
9,0,RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} (.+)$ [NC]
10,0,"RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%1/$1 [R=301,L]"
11,0,</IfModule>
12,0,```
13,,
14,1,Into this:
15,,
16,0,```
17,0,<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
18,,
19,0,RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
20,0,RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. [NC]
21,,
22,0,"# Optional: do NOT apply the rewrite rule on other subdomains (ie. local, dev, stage, forum, static, etc). "
23,0,# Uncomment the one that matches your scenario.
24,0,"   # Option 1:  for domain names with one level tld (ie. .com, .edu, .info, etc). Adapt {min,[max]} match count accordingly, if needed."
25,0,"   # RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !\.[a-z-]+\.[a-z]{2,6}$ [NC]"
26,,
27,0,"   # Option 2: for domain names with two level tld (ie. .co.uk, .com.ar, etc). Adapt {min,[max]} match count accordingly, if needed."
28,0,"   # RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !\.[a-z-]+\.[a-z]{2,3}\.[a-z]{2}$ [NC]"
29,,
30,0,# Here is the rule.
31,0,"RewriteRule ^ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]"
32,0,</IfModule>
33,0,```
34,,
35,0,A few comments on the changes:
36,0,"- no need for group capturing on the `RewriteRule` _Pattern_ nor in the `RewriteCond` _CondPattern_, as in the _Substitution_ we use the server variables (`%{HTTP_HOST}`, `%{REQUEST_URI}`). "
37,0,"  May this bring a (probably tiny, unnoticeable) performance, as there is no need to capture anything, but we use already existing variables?"
38,0,"  Also, it seems more readable, less cryptic than the `%1/$1` version."
39,0,"- it won't rewrite subdomains. That is, it only rewrite domain.com to www.domain.com, but keep intact other subdomains (dev.domain.com, stage.domain.com, forum.domain.com, etc). For this to work, you need to comment/uncomment/adapt the optional lines I've added."
