0,1,[RFC] Support Node.js native module target for Rust
1,1,We now have WebAssembly and Rust support with `--target=node`.
2,1,"While WebAssembly is awesome it is not supported by Node.js 6 without a flag and doesn't *- by design -* expose low level interfaces (any kernel stuffs, threads, SIMD, CUDA, etc..)."
3,,
4,1,The aim of this RFC is to discuss the possibility of building Rust using Node.js native modules.
5,,
6,1,"- Where can the user configure if WebAssembly or native module should be used (CLI flag, Rust macro, etc..)?"
7,1,- Should we use [Neon](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon)? If not what else?
8,1,  - Pros :
9,1,    - v8 API ❤️
10,1,"    - Easy to compare with C++ Node.js native modules (same concepts, references)"
11,1,    - Simple to use and integrate toolchain
12,1,    - Big community
13,1,  - Cons :
14,1,"    - Not compatible with WebAssembly, makes the code opinionated"
15,1,    - Need to wrap each data type
