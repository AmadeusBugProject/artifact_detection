0,1,Show tooltips based on cursors x position in line charts

3,1,I'm working with scatter charts and a large amount of points which results in an overlapping of the hover areas while trying to trigger the tooltips. I would like to bypass this mechanism and use the current x position of the mouse cursor instead to show the corresponding tooltip on the line chart. Here is an example of what I'm trying to describe in flotcharts:
