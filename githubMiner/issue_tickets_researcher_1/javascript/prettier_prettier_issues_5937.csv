4,1,"Currently, Prettier forces all CSS Selectors to be on their own line. This is a nice feature but takes too much vertical height for selectors with an initial short horizontal width. This creates unnecessarily long files for a selector that was simple to begin with."
5,,
6,1,"I propose that we add a simple config that I believe will cover every CSS developer's use case, such as: `{ styleSelectorWidth : 40} ` (default: 0 = All CSS selectors on a new line). This would behave similarly to eslint's' `max-len` rule and Prettier's rationale behind `--print-width`."
