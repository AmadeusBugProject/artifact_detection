0,1,Filter when typing without search box

3,0,``` javascript
4,0,"$("".js-example-basic-hide-search"").select2({"
5,0,  minimumResultsForSearch: Infinity
6,0,});
7,0,```

9,1,I believe that's the expect result in any select box even though the search box is not there.
10,1,The search box seems not to be very welcome for some people / client / bosses due to the fact that it alters the UI and adds an extra box.
11,1,This is an issue that [has been requested for a long time](https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/1345#issuecomment-124285439) but it seems it won't be added to the plugin.

13,1,"Therefore the closest solution would be to use a default filtering without a search box, but it seems it doesn't work either, which seems to push us away from the plugin to end up using a normal select box with bootstrap styles for the closing select box."
