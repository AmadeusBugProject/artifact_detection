0,1,Official Debian/Ubuntu packages
1,1,"Over at https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/issues/262 I asked why the Docker image installs Node.js from a tarball rather than Debian packages, and the response was:"
2,1,"> the parent Node.js project does not release DEB packages, it only provides tarballs on release. The popular NodeSource DEB repository is not official, so this image should not depend on it."

4,1,Please consider adding official Debian/Ubuntu packages to your builds. Ubuntu is probably the most popular Linux distribution so having an 'official' upstream .deb package (even if you just use Debian's or NodeSource's current packaging scripts) would be great.
