19,1,(as suggested here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36622505/typescript-array-from-in-ie11) seems to fix the problem.

21,1,I believe this issue was introduced in moving from 0.14.3 to 15.2.3 but I have not reverted to the older React to verify this.
22,,
23,1,Shouldn't React itself include this polyfill ?
