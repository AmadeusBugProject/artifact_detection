0,1,Prevent focus for mobile and/or everything
1,1,Using select2 for the first time and so far I really like it...until I took a look at my project on an ipad and iphone.

3,1,The mobile keyboard comes into play every time a select2 input is touched and it is extremely annoying and makes selection from the dropdown very tough.  If it annoyed me then I can only assume how it would annoy users and possibly cause problems as they don't understand what is going on and how to use the dropdown.
4,,
5,1,I already did a search on here about hiding the search box and everyone responds with `{minimumResultsForSearch: -1}`
6,,
7,1,"This will NOT work as a solution in this case. While it does remove the search box it does not prevent the mobile keyboard and focus.  I read comments on here that it does, but this was not the case on my ipad/iphone yesterday. I also noticed that even though the search was gone, I still had a blinking input cursor next to my first entry in the dropdown (where the search box would have been)."
8,,
9,1,"As others have pointed out... we need an option to not only remove the search box, but also remove the automatic focus."
