0,1,QuickHull warning in node.js
1,1,##### Description of the problem
2,,
3,1,"In `node.js`, the default QuickHull example throws warnings, such as:"
4,1,`THREE.Triangle: .normal() has been renamed to .getNormal().`
5,,
6,1,Also for `area()` and `midpoint()`.
7,,
8,1,"Due to issues with ES6 modules / three inclusion, it was necessary in this case for me to copy the examples, and work on them locally. Ie. "
9,0,`import * as THREE from 'three';`
10,,
11,1,"But with the above warning, the problem seems to be:"
12,0,    `triangle.normal(this.normal);`
13,0,    `triangle.midpoint(this.midpoint);`
14,,
15,1,In QuickHull. Eq. when the example was designed these were used as setters.
16,,
17,1,Are there equivalent setters in the latest build? I can't find them from the doc.
