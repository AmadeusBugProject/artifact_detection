0,0,[1.6.2 beta 12] Cannot read property 'Dependency' of undefined
1,1,I just tried to run a project using simple schema package with the latest beta and found out there's an error when booting and it won't go further.
2,0,````
3,0,TypeError: Cannot read property 'Dependency' of undefined

8,1,"Looking at the file to blame, this is the code that seems to be looking for Dependency"
9,0,````
10,0,var Deps = Package.tracker.Deps;
11,0,....
12,0,SimpleSchema._depsGlobalMessages = new Deps.Dependency();
13,0,````
14,,
15,1,So i'm guessing maybe a change on tracker removed the old Deps naming context?
16,,
17,1,UPDATE:
18,1,Looking through last commits in the tracker package I've seen exactly what I was guessing :|
19,0,#9611
20,1,I will try to open an issue at simple-schema repo and hope @aldeed can do a quick update :)
