18,1,"According to IPv6 addresses wiki page 2001:20:0:0:0:0:0:0 is in reserved range and when I do a ping, sure enough it times out."
19,,
20,1,But socket.connect on that address is succeeding. The address on the connect event shows it's one of the IPv6 IP addresses returned by nslookup on my machine. Below is the code snippet to repro.
21,1,# Code snippet:
22,,
23,0,``` js
24,0,const Socket = require('net').Socket;
25,,
26,0,const socket = new Socket({});
27,,
28,0,address = '2001:20:0:0:0:0:0:0';
29,,
30,0,socket.connect({
31,0,"    host: address,"
32,0,"    port: 80,"
33,0,});
34,,
35,0,const onError = (err) => {
36,0,"    console.log('socket error: ', err);"
37,0,};
38,,
39,0,"socket.on('error', onError);"
40,0,"socket.on('connect', function () {"
41,0,"    console.log('socket connected: ', this.address());"
42,0,});
43,0,```
