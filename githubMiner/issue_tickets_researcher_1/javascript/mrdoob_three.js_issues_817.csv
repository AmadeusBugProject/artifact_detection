0,1,low fps in project with many textured objects
1,1,"Hi,"
2,1,I have a problem with low fps in my project and have no idea why :(
3,1,"When I have few (3-5) buildings on scene everything works quite good, but when I add more buildings things are slowing down tragically (about 5 -10 fps). The more buildings I add, the less fps I have. It's a disaster for me because this is my bachelor of science thesis and I need to add about 50 more buildings to this scene."

12,1,"1.  function wykryjInteraktywnosc() will be used less  (now it's being started on each render(), but I'm going to start it only on each 5th render() )"
13,1,"2. I don't think that it can be fault of textures not being in power-of-two size, becauese in Loader it's automatically changed to POT size."
