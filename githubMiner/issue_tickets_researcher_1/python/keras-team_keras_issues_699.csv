0,1,Has an NTM actually been built in keras?
1,1,"On the home page of the documentation, there is a claim that ""...Building ... a Neural Turing Machine ... is just as fast"". This doesn't sound implausible, but I didn't think anyone had successfully reproduced the results from the NTM paper; does anyone know if this is referring to a specific NTM implementation, and if so, how well that implementation worked?"
