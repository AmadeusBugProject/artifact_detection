0,1,nxos_l3_interface reports error for SVI intfs
1,1,##### SUMMARY
2,1,WIth  nxos_ip_interface being depreciated I can only see that nxos_l3_interface should be used for IP addressing. When pointed to add IP address to SVi interface (interface vlan) it is doing switchport stuff that are not applicable to SVI intfs.
3,,
4,1,Am I using a wrong module or does it need tuing?
