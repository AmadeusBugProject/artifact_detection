0,1,Request returns broken encoding (how to use with BeautifulSoup)?
1,1,"Hello,"
2,,
3,1,I am trying to web scrap a site that contains lots of ELA questions (permission obtained). I have been trying to implement the code below:
4,0,```python
5,0,    login_url = 'https://www.helpteaching.com/registration/login.htm?'
6,0,    data = {
7,0,"        'name': '<myUserName>',"
8,0,"        'password': '<myPassword>',"
9,0,        'remember_me': 1
10,0,        }
11,0,
12,0,    with requests.Session() as s:
13,0,"        response = requests.post(login_url , data)"
14,0,        s.encoding='utf_8'
15,0,        index_page= s.get('https://www.helpteaching.com/questions/Reading_Strategies')
16,0,"        soup = BeautifulSoup(index_page.text, 'html.parser')"
17,0,```
18,,
19,1,"Note that the encoding used by the site is utf-8, and I even manually adjusted the encoding to 'utf-8'."
20,1,"However, when execute the code above, the texts are all broken."
21,,
22,1,Is there any way that I can use Requests with BeautifulSoup?
23,,
24,1,I am using Python 3.7.0.
25,,
26,1,"Thank you,"
