0,1,Missing Series name when using count() on groupby object
1,1,Consider this very basic group by operation:
2,,
3,0,``` python
4,0,"df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c'], 'col2': [1, 3, 2, 5]})"
5,0,df_grp = df.groupby('col1')['col2']
6,0,```
7,,
8,1,"When aggregating using `mean`, `min`, ... (everything but `count`) the resulting Series has `col2` as its name:"
9,,
10,0,``` python
11,0,df_grp.mean()
12,0,
13,0,col1
14,0,a       1.5
15,0,b       3.0
16,0,c       5.0
17,0,"Name: col2, dtype: float64"
18,0,```
19,,
20,1,"However, if I use `count` for aggregation, the name is not set:"
21,,
22,0,``` python
23,0,df_grp.count()
24,0,
25,0,col1
26,0,a       2
27,0,b       1
28,0,c       1
29,0,dtype: int64
30,0,```
31,,
32,1,"Not a big problem for a simple case like that, but I stumbled over that while working with a MultiIndex that needed to be reindexed and led to a `KeyError` due to that missing column name."
