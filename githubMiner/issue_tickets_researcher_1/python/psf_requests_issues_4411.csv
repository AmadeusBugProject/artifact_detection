0,1,PATCH request with form-data file has wrong content-length
1,1,I have a script that submits either a POST or PATCH request with a particular binary file. It fails when using PATCH but is successful using POST. Testing with Postman gives expected results.
2,1,
3,1,## Expected Result
4,,
5,1,Post & Patch with same content-length
6,,
7,1,## Actual Result
8,,
9,1,Patch method has much smaller content-length (not sure if being calculated wrong or if the body is malformed)
10,,

19,0,"    ""https://httpbin.org/post"", "
20,0,    files = {'file': testFile}
21,0,)
22,0,
23,0,patchResp = requests.patch(
24,0,"    ""https://httpbin.org/patch"", "
25,0,    files = {'file': testFile}
26,0,)
27,0,
28,0,"print(""Post content length:"" + postResp.headers['content-length'])"
