0,1,Unable to create multiple python lambdas with same module names
1,1,"I am unable to create multiple python lambdas that share module names. For example, I have several functions that all have a `helpers.errors` module that implements various custom Exception types for each function. When creating these functions in localstack, the first function is created normally, but the subsequent functions fail with an `ImportError` because the module from the first function is loaded."

3,1,"I've attempted different methods of loading the function code, including using the `__local__` override as will as the `ZipFile` option both within and without Docker. "

5,1,"More concisely, if I have two functions:"

7,0,function1
8,0,|--handler.py
9,0,|--helpers
10,0,     |--errors.py
11,0,         |--Exception1
12,0,         |--Exception2
13,0,```

15,0,```
16,0,function2
17,0,|--handler.py
18,0,|--helpers
19,0,     |--errors.py
20,0,         |--Exception1
21,0,         |--Exception3
22,0,```
23,1,The creation of `function2` will fail with an `ImportError` that `Exception3` cannot be imported.
