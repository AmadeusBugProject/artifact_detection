7,1,"Hi there sir I just want to say thank you for the face recognition tutorial and codes. I just want to ask how can I add at least 2 more person to recognize. Below is the sample code i already edited. Thanks for the reply nice project again sir... I just want to turn on the relay if it recognizes the ""authorized"" images..... then turn off if the face is ""Unauthorized""..."

9,1,### What I Did is I tried to add another image then change some code(s) but unfortunately it didn't come up as planned hehehe... :D
