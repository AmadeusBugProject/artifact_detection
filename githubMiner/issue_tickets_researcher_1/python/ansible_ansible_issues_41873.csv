0,1,"letsencrypt.py reporting incorrect ""cert_days"""
1,1,##### SUMMARY
2,1,"On June 23rd I got an alert of a certificate set to expire on July 21st, 28 days later. I use a daily renewal cronjob that uses the letsencrypt module with a ""remaining_days"" of 30, so it should have activated 2 days ago."
