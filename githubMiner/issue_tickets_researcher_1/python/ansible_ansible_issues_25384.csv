0,1,All defaults_from to use files outside of a role
1,1,##### ISSUE TYPE
2,,
3,1, - Feature Idea
4,,
5,1,##### COMPONENT NAME
6,0,https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/include_role_module.html
7,,
8,1,##### ANSIBLE VERSION
9,,
10,0,```
11,0,ansible 2.2.2.0
12,0,```
13,,
14,1,##### CONFIGURATION
15,,
16,1,##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
17,1,N/A
18,,
19,1,##### SUMMARY
20,1,"I would like to be able to override some defaults when including a role, but still allow those new defaults to be overridable at the group_vars level."
21,,
22,,
23,,
24,,
25,,
26,1,##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
27,1,Currently defaults_from will only look for files within the included role
28,,
29,0,```yaml
30,0,- include_role:
31,0,    name: geerlingguy.nginx
32,0,    defaults_from: ../roles/ansible-liferay-nginx/defaults/liferay.yml
33,0,```
34,,
35,1,##### EXPECTED RESULTS
36,1,liferay.yml included instead of the roles defaults/main.yml
37,,
38,1,##### ACTUAL RESULTS
39,,
40,0,```
41,0,ERROR! Could not find specified file in role: liferay.yml
42,0,```
43,,
44,1,##### Followup
45,,
46,1,"So even if this was to work, it still means that liferay.yml must be a complete fork of all the defaults of the core nginx module. In reality what I'm looking for it some like:-"
47,,
48,0,```yaml
49,0,- include_role:
50,0,    name: geerlingguy.nginx
51,0,    defaults_override: ../roles/ansible-liferay-nginx/defaults/liferay.yml
52,0,```
53,1,"and liferay.yml only includes the defaults we want to change, and these defaults are still overridable at group_vars level if needed."
54,,
55,1,The current workaround is to include the nginx config needed for liferay to function correctly in :-
56,,
57,0,ansible-liferay-nginx/vars/main.yml
58,,
59,1,However the caveat is that this config is not overridable at group_var level if it was needed to be.
