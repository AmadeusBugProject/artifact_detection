0,1,Importing __config__ isn't working without explicit PATH env var
1,1,Hi!
2,,
3,1,After updating numpy to 1.14.0 (which is dependency for pandas used in our project) it became impossible to run project without explicitly passing PATH variable to the global environment.
4,,
5,1,I believe the source of the bug is the next line:
6,0,https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/f1d81d84a2c8e3f44c434d580ab988912f9a4c83/numpy/distutils/misc_util.py#L2307
7,,
8,1,Full stack for the error:
