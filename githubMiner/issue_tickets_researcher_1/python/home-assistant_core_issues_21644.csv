33,1,**Description of problem:**
34,1,If I use `telnet 192.168.154.13 1705` on the Ubuntu Container I can connect to the Snapserver. Inside the Docker container telnet is not installed so I just tried `curl 192.168.154.13:1705` which gives me a parse error (which is expected). So curl actually CAN connect to the Snapserver from the Docker container. But the Snapcast platform still won't start (Connection Refused).
