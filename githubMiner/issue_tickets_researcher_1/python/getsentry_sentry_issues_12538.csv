3,1,How are you running Sentry?

5,1,* [x ] On-Premise docker [Version 9.0]
6,1,* [ ] Saas (sentry.io)
7,1,* [ ] Other [briefly describe your environment]

9,1,## Description
10,,
11,1,"I sent 3 events to sentry (same error, different user data):"
12,0,"1) Id = ""A/1"", Username = ""Abc"""
13,0,"2) Id = ""A/2"", Username = ""Abc"" "
14,0,"3) Id = ""A/3"", Email= ""email"""
15,,
16,1,user parsing on sentry side did not produce expected results:
17,,
18,1,* last event's user data was not processed because email was invalid. IMHO sentry should not be responsible for validating whether e-mails are correctly formed. Malformed e-mail may be by itself a result of an error.
19,1,"* user statistics for the error show 1 user, because of the previous point AND because grouping is done per Username and not by Id. This is incorrect behaviour, because an application connected to sentry can have multiple installations. In such case, one would expect that Ids are unique globally (for example prepended with installation name), but usernames don't have to be. Prepending installation name to username is not a good idea, because then, the ""avatar"" functionality takes first character from the prepended part."

23,1,### What you expected to happen
24,,
25,1,"User Statistics should group by user id, not by username"
26,1,"Incorrect emails should be accepted, but in sentry web app, they should be flagged as malformed."
