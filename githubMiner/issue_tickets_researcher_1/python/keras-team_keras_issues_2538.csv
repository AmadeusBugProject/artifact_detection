0,1,Exception's stacktrace is not properly propagated
1,1,[`raise e`](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/3779b8a008d199fe1f2ea0b05254a7d775500e5a/keras/engine/training.py#L1374) does not properly propagate the stacktrace of the exception. This makes debugging errors in the framework very painful.
