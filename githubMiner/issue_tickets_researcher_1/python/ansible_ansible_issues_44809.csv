25,1,##### SUMMARY
26,1,<!--- Explain the problem briefly -->
27,1,"I have to manage the network printers and local printers for many Linux and macOS stations . It would be nice if there is a Ansible module which manages printers. One would need to possibility to add and remove printers and perhaps also to change the settings of these printers. At the moment, I do this manually via the cups webinterace at localhost:631."
