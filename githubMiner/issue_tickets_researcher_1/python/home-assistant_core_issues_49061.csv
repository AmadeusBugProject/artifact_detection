5,1,"I do, however, have an issue with the Zwave in wall remote (on/off switches basically), both are Eminent EM6514 switches or better known as Everspring HAC01. These devices are added succesfully by the Zwave.js integration, however no entities are created and I also don't see any events on toggling the switches."

26,1,So I'm not sure how to get these switches working properly and if this is a bug in the add-on or not? According to here: https://devices.zwave-js.io/ (search for HAC01) the device configuration does exist in the Zwave.js library.
