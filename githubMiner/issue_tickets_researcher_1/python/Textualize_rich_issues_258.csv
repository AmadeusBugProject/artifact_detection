0,1,[REQUEST] Default syntax rendering for inline code using Markdown
1,1,"No similar issue: I have checked and did not see a similar feature request in any issue (open or close) with the word ""code""."

5,1,"It would be nice if inline markdown code, `like this`, could be rendered by pygments in a default theme+language (lexer) for consistency with the way that code blocks are rendered instead of in a uniform style defined by `markdown.code`."

7,1,**What problem does it solved for you?**

9,1,"In one of my project (friendly-traceback), I use code-blocks to show where an exception was raised. I then add some text, explaining the source of the problem, in which either single identifiers or parts of a line of code  are inserted in a phrase using single backticks to identify as code. The lack of consistency in styling is less than ideal."

11,1,"Note: I have looked at rich's own code to see if I could monkeypatch it (which I do for some other things in my project) and could not find an easy way to do what I would like it to do.  I've also used markdown with Sphinx, which uses Python as a default for code blocks and found that it too was not rendering inline code as Python code with the appropriate pygments theme. As far as I could tell, it does not look like something that would be easy to do and would completely understand if this issue would be closed with ""won't fix"".  However, if it looks like it **might** be possible to monkeypatch rich (and/or commonmark?) to do this, I would appreciate if I could get some pointers as I would be willing to experiment further on my own."
