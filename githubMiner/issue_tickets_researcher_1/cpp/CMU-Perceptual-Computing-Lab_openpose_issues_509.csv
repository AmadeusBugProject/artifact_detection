0,1,Running performance test
1,1,I want to test the performance by using Quadro-P6000 and Quadro-M6000.
2,1,My system environment is described as blow:
3,1,"**Ubuntu 16.04,Cuda 9.0,cuDNN 7.0,Nvidia Driver Version--384.111(suitable for both P6000 and M6000).**"
4,,
5,1,When i run with the command:
6,0,`./openpose.bin --video demo.mp4 --resolution 1280x720 --net_resolution 1312x736 --write_video result.avi`
7,,
8,1,The P6000(3.5 fps) is about ~20% faster than the M6000(2.9).
9,,
10,1,When i run the command:
11,0,`./openpose.bin --video demo.mp4 --resolution 1280x720 --net_resolution 656x368 --write_video result.avi`
12,,
13,1,The P6000 and M6000 both about  ~10 fps.
14,,
15,1,I think it might be that the P6000/M6000 both have enough cores to parallel process one image at one time with the `net_resolution=656x368`.But they couldn't do that with the `net_resolution=1312x736`.
16,,
17,1,But i want to compare the running time between P6000 and M6000 by using the option `net_resolution=656x368`.How could i do that.
18,,
19,1,Any help is appreciated.Thanks a lot!
