0,1,Unable to use heatmaps + heatmaps questions
1,1,### Issue summary
2,1,When I ran openpose  on a full HD(1920x1080) frame it dumps a heatmap of size 24928x368. In this frame it has detected just one person and I have used --heatmaps_add_PAFs flag with which I expect it dumps 2x19 PAFs wrto all the limbs.

4,1,Can you help me make sense out of this heatmap output? I understand that it is the unit vector for each limb but in what form it is stored that I am unable to figure out.
