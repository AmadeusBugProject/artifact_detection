0,1,Error while training from scratch. AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'image_summary'
1,1,I have latest version of TF and latest pull of inception model installed.
2,,
3,1,**I am trying to train inception from Scratch!
4,1,"Note: So Initially I have 2000 images of 2.5megapixel size, divided into 2 labels."
5,1,Note: I don't have bounding boxes in image data set.**
6,1,"Step1:- I shraded my image data set of about 2000 images into TFRecord files successfully, using ::"
7,0,"`bazel-bin/inception/build_image_data   --train_directory=""/home/airig/scratch/img_data_set/train_img""   --validation_directory=""/home/airig/scratch/img_data_set/validation_img""   --output_directory=""/home/airig/scratch/img_data_set/out_dir""   --labels_file=""/home/airig/scratch/img_data_set/gro_labels.txt""`"
8,1,Finished writing all 2000 images in data set.
9,1,Step2:- I ran

12,1, but Now I am getting a new error:--
