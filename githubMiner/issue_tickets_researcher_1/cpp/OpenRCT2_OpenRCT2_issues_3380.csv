5,1,I'd like to put forward an idea of integrating a code formatter into our process. There are quite a few possible options:
6,0,- `astyle` – http://astyle.sourceforge.net/
7,0,- `uncrustify` – http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/
8,0,- `clang-format` – http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html

10,1,"These are just the most-well-known ones, I'm sure there are plenty more."

12,1,"Out of these options I would strongly recommend to go with `clang-format`, for the most basic reason: it is compatible with patches. It can check and re-format just the change you're about to introduce, which allows for natural and gradual deployment of code style, minimising disruptiveness of the change."
