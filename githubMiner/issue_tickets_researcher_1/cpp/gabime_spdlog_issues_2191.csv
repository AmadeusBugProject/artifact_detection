6,1,The docs say for `%@` `Source file and line` with example `my_file.cpp:123`. This is however not the case for me.

8,0,```c++
9,0,"set_pattern(""%@"");"
10,0,```
11,,
12,0,causes `..\..\..\Client\Serializer.cpp:54` instead of `Client\Serializer.cpp:54` or just `Serializer.cpp:54`
13,1,This is caused because `__FILE__` expands to that.
14,,
15,1,"On clang there exists `__FILE_NAME__`, which is just the file name without a path."
16,1,"Otherwise some sort of `String::ReplaceAll(msg.source.filename, ""..\\"", """")` could make sense too."
17,1,Otherwise it would be nice if there was a way to set the base path for all these patterns.
