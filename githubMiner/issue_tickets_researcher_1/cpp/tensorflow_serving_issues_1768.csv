23,1,### System information
24,1,"- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS"
25,1,- **TensorFlow Serving installed from (source or binary)**: Docker Image
26,,
27,1,### Describe the problem
28,1,"Since Docker 19.03, you need to install nvidia-container-toolkit package and then use the --gpus all flag. The docker command to run the container with GPUs needs --gpus=all parameter so that the GPU devices are visible within the container. The command should instead be (if we want to assign all available GPUs to docker)"
29,,
30,0,sudo docker run -it -p 8500:8500 --gpus all tensorflow/serving:latest-devel-gpu
31,,
32,1,If you want to assign specific device then change it to --gpus device=0
