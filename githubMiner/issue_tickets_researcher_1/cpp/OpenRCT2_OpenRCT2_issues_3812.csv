0,1,Cheat to prevent excitement penalty on multiple rides of same type
1,1,"There's a cheat to reset all ride aging, but none to prevent it in the first place.  This would be very useful to prevent having to toggle this every few years.  A cheat to remove the penalty on ride excitement if multiple rides of the same type are built would also be really useful, especially in multiplayer parks."
