27,1,"Using latest early access version of Yuzu at time of writing, 168. This appears to be a known issue since it's mentioned on the game's compatibility page, but I was unable to find an entry for it here. In Link's Awakening, nearly all sound effects are missing, with the exception of several character voices. The music tracks all sound to work properly. This issue can be observed in many YouTube playthroughs of LA in Yuzu, and it appears unchanged even in the latest release. https://youtu.be/RCLMulpACLg"
