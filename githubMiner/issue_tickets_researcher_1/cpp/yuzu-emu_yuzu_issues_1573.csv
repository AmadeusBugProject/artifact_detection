16,1,"So that's it.. I have always believed that the installer won't work behind a proxy, but was pretty surprised when I found that it cannot work with VPN connected either. The VPN I'm using is a simple L2TP connection, and yuzu installer won't open with it connected. Instead, a ""Web navigation cancelled"" message is shown, and if I refresh the page, it shows the common IE error ""Cannot open this page"" instead. When a proxy is connected, I get the same message."

18,1,"I'm not sure if this can be fixed, but I believe this is something that deserves to be considered an issue. As this installer has become official, I decided to open an issue here so that it doesn't get ignored. (actually should probably have opened it in j-selby/liftinstall instead...)"
