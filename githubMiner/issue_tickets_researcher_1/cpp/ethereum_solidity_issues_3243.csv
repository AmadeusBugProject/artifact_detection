3,0,- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/labels/good%20first%20issue
4,0,- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/labels/up-for-grabs
5,,
6,1,Let's use `help wanted` or `good first issue` because GitHub adds special meaning to them: https://help.github.com/articles/about-labels/#using-default-labels.
