0,1,Change camera forward direction and draw depth plane
1,1,I currently using open3d python for 3d visualization.
2,,
3,1,"For my goal, I want to change camera forward direction using normal vector and want to draw depth plane for verify to plane sweeping method can fully cover point cloud."
4,,
5,1,So i converted depth map to point cloud and at this point. And then i want to change camera forward direction about normal vector. But i can't search information about that.
6,,
7,1,Clear up of my question :
8,,
9,1,1.How can i change camera forward direction using normal vector?
10,,
11,1,2.How can i draw depth plane in 3D point cloud ?
12,,
13,1,Could you give me advice ?
14,,
15,1,Below is my code:
16,0,```
17,0,import numpy as np
18,0,import open3d as o3d
19,,
20,0,def main():
21,0,  normal_0 = np.load('./normal_0.npy')
22,0,"  normal_1 = (normal_0*(50/65535.)).reshape(3,1).astpye(np.float64)"
23,,  
24,0,  normal_0 = o3d.geometry.PointCloud()
25,0,  normal0.points = o3d.utility.Vector3dVector([normal_0])
26,0,"  normal0.paint_uniform_color([1, 0.706, 0])"
27,,  
28,0,"  cloud = o3d.io.read_point_cloud(""pc.ply"")"
29,0,"  o3d.visualzation.draw_geometries([cloud, normal0])"
30,0,  VC = o3d.visualization.ViewControl()
31,0,  VC.set_front(normal0)
32,0,"if __name__ == ""__main__"":"
33,0,  main()
34,0,```
